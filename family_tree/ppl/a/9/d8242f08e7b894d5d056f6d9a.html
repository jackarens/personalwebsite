				------<br />
				{{Scottish Clans}} [[Category:Clan Leslie]][[Category:Earl of Ross]]<br />
				----<br />
				== Biography ==
				</p>
				<p>
				=== Birth ===Sir Walter Leslie was a son of Sir Andrew Leslie, 6th of Leslie, and Mary Abernethy&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-1]]  Page 19.  Although there is contention whether he was second or fourth this record suggests the fourth.  He was certainly younger than Norman.&lt;/ref&gt;. They were likely married before December 1300, she was co-heiress to the considerable Abernethy estates.   All the Leslie family were well regarded by King David II and all are found in the King's service in some fashion.  Walter was likely born around 1310.  Norman, the second son, was of age about 1330, thus born before 1310, when he receives a “pension” for enduring the ward of Balenbreich and Walter was younger than Norman.
				</p>
				<p>
				=== Slight Conjecture with Original Source Material ===John Leslie, Bishop of Ross&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-2]] on page 201.&lt;/ref&gt;, states that Walter Leslie served against the Saracens in the Imperial army under the Emperors Louis IV and Charles IV with great distinction and was so esteemed for his bravery against the enemy, and for his humanity towards the vanquished, that he was styled the "Generous Knight."  It is difficult to reconcile this sentence with history as there were no “crusades” against the “Saracens” during his service with the Holy Roman Empire. It is likely that the author is confused about two different events in the history of Walter Leslie.  <br />
				Sir Walter Leslie was, however, regarded as one of the foremost knights of his time and his service overseas gained him a reputation for valour and chivalry and he found great favour with many of the Kings of the day including King [[Bruce-510|David II of Scotland]] who was always captivated by his exploits on foreign lands.
				</p>
				<p>
				==In Service of Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire 1342 - 1354==Walter Leslie&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-3]] The Scots Peerage; vol 7, pp 241-244 &lt;/ref&gt; seems that he found employ in Europe soon after he came of age, initially with the King of Bohemia, John, and later, under Charles IV, with the Holy Roman Empire, the Imperial Army mentioned above.<br />
				This service may have led him to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cr%C3%A9cy Battle of Crécy], in 1346, in support of John of Bohemia. The Holy Roman Emperor at the time of the battle of Crécy was Louis IV and a supporter of England against France and the Pope.  Unlike the hereditary kings of Europe, the Holy Roman Empire elected its kings and following the death of John of Bohemia at Crécy, his son, Charles IV, was elected, replacing Louis IV.  The record suggests Walter served the King of the Romans, Charles IV, “with some distinction�� according to the family historian.<br />
				&lt;span style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"&gt;[[Image:Leslie-464-1.png|100px]]&lt;/span&gt;The original family history “Laurus Leaslaena” records him as “Walter the Wight Leslie”&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-4]] &lt;/ref&gt; possibly being a reflection on membership to Teutonic Knights as they wore the white surcoats with a black cross but there is no evidence to his membership of this Order.  Or simply a recognition of chivalry in the field of battle.  <br />
				In the Historical Record of the Leslies his service to the Holy Roman Empire is elaborated upon.  Emperor Ferdinand created him a Count of the Holy Roman Empire and provided him with large estates in what is now Bohemia, Germany.  It seems that these rights were heritable as James, Count Leslie, eldest son of Alexander Leslie, fourteenth [[:Category:Baron of Balquhain|Baron of Balquhain]], who succeeded his uncle, Count Walter, in Germany, and was a Field-Marshal in the Imperial service, and held a command in the Imperial army under John Sobieski, King of Poland, in 1683, during the famous siege of Vienna by the Turks; also James Ernest, Count Leslie, eldest son of Patrick, Count Leslie, fifteenth Baron of Balquhain, who succeeded his uncle, James, second Count Leslie in Germany, and was ancestor of the succeeding Counts Leslie.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-1]] Leslie, Charles Joseph; Volume 1; page 106&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				His service with Charles IV must have ceased at some point around 1350 as Walter seems to have found service with the Duke of Austria, leading to an obligation of fealty which is reflected in a later, 1372, grant by Charles V of France.  Later in life he, and his wife, will mount their armorial on an eagle which, in style, looks similar to that used by the Holy Roman Empire at the time.
				</p>
				<p>
				== Return to Scotland ==Walter Leslie returned to Scotland about 1354 to find his King, David II, a prisoner in England and his brother, Norman Leslie, now one of Scotland's negotiators for the release of David working with a Council led by the High Steward, Robert Stewart.  Another of the negotiators, Sir [[Douglas-391|William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas]], will feature later in his life.<br />
				In 1356 the Historical Record of the Leslies suggests “Walter Leslie seems to have gone to the wars in Germany in 1356, as he and his brother Norman had a safe-conduct to pass through England on their way to Prussia, 20th August 1356.”&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-1]] On page 20. &lt;/ref&gt;  There were no wars in or about the Holy Roman Empire at this date. The brothers were back in Scotland later that year and thus it was a short visit. <br />
				It seems likely that they were either; involved in an attempt to win support and funds from Charles IV, known to Sir Walter Leslie, for the ransom payments for David II for which Sir Norman Leslie was responsible, and thus attended the Diet at either Nuremburg or Metz for the announcement of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Bull_of_1356 Golden Bull of 1356] thus creating the Holy Roman Empire; or attending, in “Prussia”, the opening Charter of the creation of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League Hanseatic League] which had major trading impact to the cities of Aberdeen and Leith; or with Sir [[Douglas-391|William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas]] (same person on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Douglas,_1st_Earl_of_Douglas wikipedia])  and the Scottish contingent atthe [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Poitiers Battle of Poitiers] on 19 September 1356, or a combination of them.<br />
				But whatever they were doing they were back in Scotland before the end of the year. Norman was one of Scotland's senior commissioners and later Deputy-Chamberlain to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Stewart,_2nd_Earl_of_Angus Thomas Stewart, 2nd Earl of Angus] (on [[Stewart-1183|WikiTree]]) and then “armour-bearer” to the King in 1359.  It should be pointed out that Thomas Stewart was a cousin to Walter and Norman Leslie, Thomas' mother was Margaret Abernethy, sister to Walter's mother.
				</p>
				<p>
				== In Service of France 1358 - 1361 ==In 1358 he receives a safe-conduct through England for himself and sixty persons in his party, "going to foreign parts".  The authority was for a departure on 24th October 1358. It would seem that his mercenary band was heading for France to aid Charles V, then the Dauphin, in his strife against England.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-5]] Although Sir John le Grant was in the commission (dated at Edinburgh, 10th May 1359) Dalyrmple, Vol 2, page 298 suggests that it does not appear that he ever acted. &lt;/ref&gt;  His brother, Norman Leslie, along with Sir Robert Erskine, were plenipotentiaries appointed by David II for dealings with France and were in Paris, in May 1359, renewing the alliance between France and Scotland and while there is no evidence the brothers were together it seems probable.  Erskine and Leslie were at the Louvre, in June 1359, and obtained 50,000 merks in payment for Scotland renewing their efforts against England&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-6]] Dalrymple, vol 1. page 391.&lt;/ref&gt;, some of which was applied against the ransom on David II.<br />
				A consideration of the state of France at the time suggests that Walter Leslie, and his mercenary band, were working to protect the Dauphin during internal strife.  In 1358, a peasant revolt in France called the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquerie Jacquerie] took place and although short it meant the royal family lost control of Paris.  Paris was only recovered in about October. Walter Leslie and his band of 60 were typical of the groups that found service with the royal family in France at the time.  Capitalising on the discontent in France, Edward III assembled his army at Calais in the late summer of 1359.  His first objective was to take the city of Rheims. However, the citizens of Rheims had built and reinforced the city's defences before Edward and his army arrived.  Edward besieged Rheims for five weeks but the new fortifications held out. He lifted the siege and moved his army on to Paris in the Spring of 1360.  His army was weakened from disease and from being harried by small groups of French and mercenary companies engaging in highly mobile actions.  One of these groups would have been led by Walter Leslie.  On reaching Paris Edward's army was exhausted and after a few skirmishes in the suburbs he retreated back towards Calais. When the Dauphine offered negotiations he was ready to agree. Leslie is said, by the family historian, to have served with distinction in the wars against Edward III of England and these would have been the actions that he served in.  It is likely that, at this time, he came to the notice of a French knight [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_du_Guesclin Bertrand du Guesclin] on whose strategy the actions against Edward III were largely based.  The war concluded with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Br%C3%A9tigny Treaty of Brétigny] in May 1360 and, with service to France concluded, and, with future pay doubtful, he and his band returned to Scotland where his exploits found favour with King David II.<br />
				Of a further historical note of this period it seems likely that one of the band of knights fighting with Walter Leslie may have been [[Sinclair-735|William Sinclair, 2nd of Roslyn]] who “had a safe-conduct to go into England on 6 May 1358 on his way abroad to Prussia to fight in foreign wars”.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-3]] The Scots Peerage; Balfour Paul, Ed 1904, Vol. 6, page 567.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prussia being used at this period as a destination rather than France. Although he may have been back in Scotland by 17 September 1358 to receive an annuity of his grandfather confirmed to him he may have returned to France. He died soon after this event under circumstances which are notrecorded. Walter Leslie, as we will note later, is closely affiliated with this family.
				</p>

				== Scotland and Marriage 1360 - 1365 ==Sir Walter Leslie was back in Scotland probably late 1360 or early 1361.  The fame of his exploits gained him the favour of King David II, who, 14th October 1362, granted him a pension for life of forty pounds sterling, to be paid annually out of the great Customs of Dundee by the Chamberlain of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-7]] p. 32, No. 75 where it is recorded as being in the 34th year of his reign.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-8]] Exchequer Rolls of Scotland; vol 2, page 140&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				The plague hit Scotland in 1361 which devastated the nation.  Dalrymple notes that nearly a third of the population perished,&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-6]] Dalrymple, Vol 1, page 392. &lt;/ref&gt; including many of the nobility, his cousin, Thomas Stewart, 2nd Earl of Angus, the ex-Chamberlain, amongst them, along with a number being held by the English as surety for the ransom of David II, including John, the son of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_de_Moravia,_5th_Earl_of_Sutherland William, Earl of Sutherland].<br />
				In 1363 he and his brother Norman accompanied David II to England to discuss the terms of the peace treaty and ransom and participated in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banquet_of_the_Five_Kings Banquet of the Five Kings] thus meeting [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_I_of_Cyprus Peter I of Cyprus] in his endeavours to gather support for a crusade to "liberate" the Holy Land and the Kingdom of Jerusalem of which he was nominally king.  This party also included Sir John Sinclair of Hermanston, now the husband of Margaret Sinclair, sister to [[Sinclair-735|William Sinclair, 2nd of Roslyn]].  Although none of the kings, or indeed the Pope, supported Peter I's endeavours with financing, the “Crusade” was supported by the city state of Venice, and a few of Scotland's knights will follow his call.<br />
				Through the influence and friendship of King David II, Walter Leslie, now aged about 53, married [[Ross-1119|Eufamia]], eldest daughter and heiress of [[Ross-1061|William, sixth Earl of Ross]], who was about 18 at the time without her father's sanction&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-3]] The Scots Peerage; Balfour Paul, Ed 1904, Vol. 7, page 239.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The marriage likely occurs sometime before September 1363 and possibly as early as 1362 as David II grants to "Walter de Leslie, knight, and Eufamia de Ross his spouse, lands of the new forest in the shire of Dumfries, to be held of the king in free barony", dated at Perth, 13th September 1365.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-7]] p. 53, No. 162 where it is recorded as being in the 37th year if his reign.&lt;/ref&gt;  <br />
				It is clear that this marriage was arranged by David II with the intention of gaining control of the Earldom of Ross, the last remaining bastion of the Mormaers.  [[Ross-1061|William, sixth Earl of Ross]] was also Lord of Skye and held the strongest dominion north of Perth.  When his uncle Sir John le Ross, died he also inherited half of the lands of the earldom of Buchan.  Further, he held large pieces of land in Argyll as various Charters by him to his brother, Hugh, illustrate.  He was an enormously powerful noble, powerful enough to escape even the Kings' retribution for the murder of Ronald MacRuari in the monastery of Elcho in 1346.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-3]] Balfour Paul, Ed 1904, Vol. 7, page 237. &lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				But Walter was not there for most of the arguments, nor for the grants to the forest of Dumfries, and had left Scotland late 1363.  Since he does not return until after the grant in Sep 1365 he must have been married prior to leaving Scotland.  This is further suggested when David II infefts his "cousin", Walter de Lesly, knight, heritably in the thanage of Aberkerdor and its pertinents in the county of Banff, and in the thanages of Kyncardyn.   David II, in the same year, 1363, issues two further Charters to Walter de Lesly,—one of the fee of the thanages of Kyncardin, Aberbrothnok, and Fettercairn, with their bondmen, bondages, and followers, and erecting the same into a feudal barony, with the usual jurisdiction, and under the obligation of rendering military service; and another of the thanage of Aberkerdor, likewise erected into a barony in similar terms.   <br />
				There is then a record of passage of a safe-conduct for Walter and Norman, his brother, to travel to the Holy Land dated 23 November 1363 suggesting they had left.&lt;ref&gt;“Celtic Scotland; A History of Ancient Alban”; William Skene, 1886 in 3 Volumes; Vol III, page 247.  Reg. Mag. Sig., pp. 66, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  He passed through Italy as they appear at Florence as witnesses to a contract signed by the authorities of Florence with the notorious English "White Band", a group of English mercenaries who had fought in the Hundred Years War plying their trade in Italy and may even have known members of that mercenary group.  They then took ship to Rhodes and the Crusades.

				=== Slight Conjecture with Original Source Material ===It is worth pointing out that the The Scots Peerage is in error of timings.  The marriage certainly occurred before 1365 and must have occurred before Leslie left for the Crusade in 1363.  The "mutiny" mentioned in Balfour Paul's work, by [[Ross-1061|William, sixth Earl of Ross]], must have been as a result of the marriage occurring and not a reason for the marriage.

				== The Alexandrian Crusade - 1365 ==October 1365 - It is unknown how many answered the call, although they did include Walter and Norman Leslie and probably Henry Sinclair, but knights from across Christendom gathered at the Crusader stonghold of Rhodes in the early part of 1365.  They thought they were going to the Holy Land.<br />
				Lacking any form of religious support, other than possibly the blessing of the Pope, the “[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandrian_Crusade Alexandrian Crusade]]” was largely a financial endeavour funded by the city state of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice Republic of Venice]].  The actual intent of Peter I, which was only made known to the Crusaders after leaving Rhodes, seems to have been to attack and capture Alexandria then, using this as a base, attack Cairo.  There appears to be no intention of going to Jerusalem.  The invasion, made on 169 ships provided by Venice, left Rhodes on 4 October 1365 and made landfall near to Alexandria on 9 October 1365. <br />
				The army sacked and looted Alexandria, a mainly Christian city, against opposition and withdrew on 12 October in the face of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk Mamluk]] army of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahri_dynasty Bahri dynasty]] approaching from Cairo. In the works of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Maqrizi Al-Maqrizi]] a contemporary historian, he suggests that the defenders focused on defending the harbour while Peter had landed the majority of his mounted troops undetected further up the coast and he was thus able to attack in front and rear. The knights, led by Norman Leslie and likely including Walter,&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-9]] MacQuarrie, page 83.&lt;/ref&gt; forced the “Customs Gate”, entered the city and the defenders never recovered from the shock and were slaughtered.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-10]] &lt;/ref&gt; [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hales Sir Robert Hales]] led the force of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller Knights Hospitaller]] at the battle and was later Grand Prior of the Order in England.<br />
				It seems probable, although not recorded, that Norman Leslie died as a result of this action as his wife issues a Charter,&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-1]] Leslie, Charles Joseph; vol 1, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-7]] p. 51, No. 151 where it is recorded as being in the 37th year if his reign.  &lt;/ref&gt; as a widow, in February 1366 to which Walter is a witness and is stated to be her brother in law.

				== Scotland and Family Affairs 1366 - 1370 ==Walter was back in Scotland at the end of 1365 or start of 1366 as he witnesses the Charter, mention prior, in February 1366.  Along with serving regularly in the Parliamentary sessions, in 1366&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-11]] K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2013), 1366/7/20&lt;/ref&gt; and 1367&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-11]] K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2013), 1367/9/1, where his father in law, William, Earl of Ross is “contumaciously” (defiantly) absent.&lt;/ref&gt; representing the nobility, he faced turmoil regarding his marriage, with dissent coming mainly from [[Ross-1061|William, sixth Earl of Ross]], his father in law.  It seems likely that William cast doubt on his honour and sought annulment of the marriage on the basis that he had “previously had illicit intercourse with a lady related within the fourth degree of kindred to Eufamia de Ross.” <br />
				He sought Papal dispensation to continue with his marriage and the Pope provided the dispensation which is dated at Avignon, viii. Kalend Decembris, anno quinto pontificatus Urbani V., 1367.  Although the other party is not named in the dispensation other evidence suggests that it was an Euphemia Sinclair, for just prior to this Walter de Leslie, grants a Charter to “Eufamia de Sancto Clare” (Euphemia Sinclair) of the lands of Tiry in Buchan, and of Bray, Drum, and Bron, in the shire of Inverness, to be held of him and his heirs by her and her heirs, for payment of two pennies yearly at the feast of St. John the Baptist, if demanded, dated 1367.

				=== Relationship with the Sinclairs ===The Scots Peerage informs&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-3]] Balfour Paul, Ed 1904, Vol. 6, page 567.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Sinclair-735|William Sinclair, 2nd of Roslyn]], a minor when his father died in 1330, inherited the title to Roslin and received a Charter from David II of Morton and Merchamyston in Midlothian on 10 February 1358.  He too “had a safe-conduct to go into England on 6 May 1358 on his way abroad to Prussia to fight in foreign wars” and although received the annuity of his grandfather, on 17 September 1358, there is no evidence he was in Scotland at the time.  He is recorded as having died close to this time but there are no details of his death.  It seems probable that he was with Walter Leslie fighting in France against Edward III and died in one of the actions.  He had married Isabella, second daughter of Malise, Earl of Strathearn, Orkney, and Caithness and is stated in The Scots Peerage to have had two children; Henry, who went on to become the Earl of Orkney and Lord of Zetland; and David, who received a charter to lands of Newburgh and Auchdale in Aberdeenshire<br />
				from David II. <br />
				Although there is no mention of an Euphemia it seems likely that Euphemia Sinclair was a sister to William and seemingly the mistress to Walter Leslie.  This would account for the papal dispensation being required as William Sinclair, brother to Euphemia, had married a daughter to the Earl of Strathearn and Euphemia Ross's aunt was Marjory and married to the same Earl, thus being within prohibited degrees.  The relationship must have occurred well before 1363 and was resolved in 1367.  That Walter Leslie was unfaithful to Euphemia Ross, his wife, is improbable and it seems more probable that this was an attempt, by [[Ross-1061|William, sixth Earl of Ross]],  to annul the marriage before they had children.

				=== Pacification of the Highlands ===In 1368, Walter was involved with the Act of Parliament&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-11]] K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2013), 1369/3/1. &lt;/ref&gt; regarding the “Pacification of the Highlands”, supporting David II in his attempts to curtail the growing power of the Steward.  This brought Walter further into conflict with his father in law who came out in support of the Steward. <br />
				Later in the same year David II granted a charter of the barony of Philorth in Aberdeenshire to “Walter de Leslie, knight”&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-12]]  Index Lost Charters; page 35, Charter 19 but this must have been 1368.&lt;/ref&gt; and Walter is later styled Lord of Philorth in a charter of infeftment of John Lyon of Terteviot.  This grant must further have antagonised, as it was no doubt designed to, William, Earl of Ross, as Philorth was a holding of the Earldom and one that he had granted to Hugh (his brother and later chief of Clan Ross).<br />
				Following further support to David, Walter is granted the thanages of Kincardine, Abirbuthnott and Fettercairn in Kincardineshire and the thanage of Abirkyrdor and the lands of Blaresenach in the sheriffdom of Banff.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-7]] p. 71, No. 243 where it is recorded as being in the 40th year of his reign.  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-7]] p. 66, No. 220 where it is recorded as being in the 40th year of his reign. &lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the Commissioners for Scotland regarding the ransom and peace treaty with England.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-13]] Bain; vol 4, page 35, No. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was one of the most powerful nobles in the Kingdom and moulded to thwart the power of the Stewarts.  His seal was attached to the treaty “Fragment, damaged. Shield with 3 buckles (?) on a bend: 'SIG . . . eslet.' 'WALTER de LESLEY' on tag”.  <br />
				He appears in Parliament again in February 1370&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-11]] K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2013), 1370/2/1. &lt;/ref&gt; and again in October when William, Earl of Ross resigns his title&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-11]] K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2013), 1370/10/1 &lt;/ref&gt; for re-grant.
				</p>
				<p>
				=== Earldom of Ross ===There is much conjecture regarding the transfer of the Earldom to Sir Walter Leslie that it is worth considering the document on the public record.  Indeed much myth has developed without consideration of fact and much of that has been perpetuated over the web.  The public record makes the status of the Earldom and the hereditary line very clear and discussion has been included here.  The transcription of that Parliament, held in Perth on 24 October 1370 is readily available.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-11]] K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2013), 1370/10/1 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Antiquities of Aberdeen and Banff; vol 2, page 386. &lt;/ref&gt;  The transcription is held as a [[Space:Records_of_Parliament|Profile page]] for easy reference.<br />
				At the time, the Earldom was extensive with control over all of Ross and out to the Isles, including Skye, along with extensive holdings in Dumfries, Wigtown and Buchan and, if combined with the holdings of Leslie in Kincardineshire, a large part of the Mearns.  David II was clearly uncomfortable that William had no male heirs and was probably uncomfortable with the knowledge that Hugh Ross, the next male in line was a strong supporter of the Steward.  With such enormous power vested into one Earldom David wanted it with someone that he trusted.  He thus “encouraged” William to resign his Earldom in order to fragment it and reinvest him in the title of Ross only.  This is clearly seen in the Parliamentary transcript.<br />
				David II also knew that Walter Leslie was about to depart for France to support Scotland's efforts against the English.  Walter, by this point, is about 60 and Euphemia, born about 1345, only 25 and it seems likely that David was attempting to secure this Earldom and the wording is significant as it has later repercussions.
				</p>
				<p>
				=== Ramifications of the Parliament ===The Charter removes the right to lands and titles in Aberdeen (Buchan), Dumfries and Wigtown from the title of Ross.  The Earldom of Ross held half the lands of Buchan which had been inherited, by right of Margaret Comyn, daughter and heiress to the Earl of Buchan, and passed to John Ross by marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-12]] Robertson's; page 2&lt;/ref&gt;  He died without heir and William, his nephew, then inherited.  These lands are removed from the Earldom.<br />
				The charter also makes it clear that William, Earl of Ross, holds the title and it would pass, in preference, to any legitimate male heir of him, but this could not have been seen as likely.  This clause thus removed any right to claim by Hugh, Lord of Philorth, his brother.<br />
				Failing legitimate male children of William, the Charter makes it clear that the Earldom of Ross would pass to Walter Leslie and Euphemia and be retained by the longest living. Thus Walter Leslie would hold the title in his own right and not simply in right of his wife.<br />
				The charter then states that legitimate heirs to Walter and Euphemia will inherit.  It adds the clause that if there are no male heirs, and “perchance she has more daughters” then the eldest daughter “always” shall inherit without division.  If there are no heirs then the title would revert to Joanna, the younger sister to Euphemia.<br />
				It is clear that, at this point (1370), Walter and Euphemia already had a daughter, Mary (Mariota) and, if we believe the History of Macdonalds and Lords of the Isles,&lt;ref&gt;See: History of Macdonalds and Lords of the Isles, page 61 &lt;/ref&gt; already engaged to Donald, Lord of the Isles.  One can only suppose this was part of the negotiations, between the High Steward, John, Lord of the Isles, and William, Earl of Ross.  <br />
				The son of Walter and Euphemia, Alexander, must have been born after this Parliament, but likely just before William, Earl of Ross, lodged his complaint to Robert Stewart, then in his capacity as King Robert II.  Alexander is described as heir-apparent when the title is again granted in 1394 suggesting he was too young, but has inherited before 1398.
				</p>
				<p>
				== France 1370 – 1372 ==Almost immediately after this Parliament, Walter left for France&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-1]] Leslie, Charles Joseph; Vol 1, page 66 &lt;/ref&gt; and is certainly back in France in November as he participates at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pontvallain Battle of Pontvallain] fought, on the 4th December 1370 under forces commanded by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_du_Guesclin Bertrand du Guesclin] who he has fought with before.<br />
				Leslie will be later recognised for this service to France, by Charles V, but while there, in February 1371, his mentor David II dies and Leslie returns quickly to Scotland.  The throne was going to pass to Robert Stewart, the High Steward of Scotland in a move that would give Walter Leslie some anxiety as he had closer ties to William, Earl of Ross.  Sir Walter de Leslie placed his seal on the Coronation of Robert II at Scone on 26 March 1371 and the Declaration of John, Earl of Carrick as heir on 27 March 1371,&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-11]] K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2013), A1371/4. &lt;/ref&gt; but leaves soon again for France.<br />
				Soon after the coronation of Robert II and while Walter was fighting in France, William, 5th Earl of Ross, files a complaint against the distribution under the Parliament of 20th October 1370.  He complained that David II had given to Sir Walter Leslie, knight, all his lands and tenements, and also those of his brother, Hugh de Ross [who, Balfour-Paul informs, was dead at this point], within the district of Buchan, ���neither the Earl, the complainant, nor his brother Hugh be in of cited”.  The complaint is well detailed in the Historical Records of the Leslies and the Antiquities of Aberdeen and Banff.  He dated the complaint and affixed his seal at Edinburgh 24 June 1371.&lt;ref&gt; Clearly detailed in the Antiquities of Aberdeen and Banff; vol 2, page 387. &lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				There is no record of what Robert did with this complaint.  In action he did nothing.  We know that William, 5th Earl of Ross, died soon after, at Delny on 9 February 1372,&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-3]] Balfour Paul, Ed 1904; vol 7, page 239. &lt;/ref&gt; and it seems likely that it was very soon after, leaving no male issue, he was succeeded in his Earldom and estates by Walter Leslie and Eufamia.<br />
				Walter Leslie was, at this point, still in France.  He was in Paris until late October when he receives from Charles V King of France, by a letter patent dated 1st October 1372, granted to him as “Earl of Ross in the kingdom of Scotland, an annuity of 200 francs of gold, to be paid out of the Royal Treasury, for his good and faithful services against our ancient enemies of England, especially at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pontvallain Battle of Pontvallain]”.  Leslie had fought under [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_du_Guesclin Bertrand du Guesclin] after du Guesclin as recalled to service as Constable of France by Charles V of France in 1370.  Probably the most successful French commander of the period he was noted for the employment of fast hitting guerilla tactics and attempted to avoid meeting the English in pitched battles.  He found success immediately at the Battle of Pontvallain.  It seems probable that Leslie remained with du Guesclin during the reconquering of Poitou and Saintonge forcing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward,_the_Black_Prince Edward, the Black Prince] out of France.  <br />
				It is interesting to note that, for this pension, Walter de Leslie did “homage to the King of France against all and every one,''' reserving the fidelity due by him to the King of Scotland and the Duke of Austria'''”.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-1]] Leslie, Charles Joseph; Vol 1, page 66&lt;/ref&gt; The reference to the Duke of Austria is not clear from the historical record unless it relates to his time with Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire, although noting that Austria was not part of it at that time.

				==Return to Scotland 1372 ==&lt;span style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"&gt;[[Image:Leslie-464-2.png|150px]]&lt;/span&gt;  Leslie is back in Scotland in late 1372 and now about 62 years old.  He does not again appear on the Parliamentary record of Scotland and does not hold the same sway with Robert II as he did with David II.  Although he and his wife were now Earl and Countess of Ross they never use the title during his lifetime.  In every transaction they are Lord and Lady of Ross.<br />
				His seal,&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-14]] Laing's; No. 496. Stated to be of 1367 but includes the arms of Ross quartered and thus after being raised to Earl.&lt;/ref&gt; appended to Charters of the day contains the eagle, possibly representative of his service with the Holy Roman Empire.  This eagle is to continue after his death in the seal of his wife.<br />
				In 1373 Walter resigned his lands in Galloway and in 1375 he, and Euphemia, resolved the issue of the inheritance with her sister Janet (stated as Joanna in the Parliamentary Records mentioned prior) and, as Lord and Lady of Ross, they grant a charter to his brother-in-law, Sir Alexander Fraser, knight, and Janet Ross, his wife, of the lands of Auchinschogle and Meikle Fyntra in Buchan, and of the lands of Crekiltown, in the lordship of Galloway and shire of Wigton, and of an annual rent of eighteen pounds sterling out of the lands of Farindonald in Ross, in full exchange and compensation for all claim of heritage in the lands of Ross accruing to the said Sir Alexander Fraser and Janet Ross, dated at Aberdeen, 4 June 1375.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S38]] Leslie, Charles Joseph; Vol 1, page 73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1378 he resigned his lands in Kincardineshire in favour of Patrick de Innerpeffer, a burgess of Dundee.

				== Death and Legacy ==Walter Leslie, Earl of Ross, died at Perth on 27 February 1382,&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-3]] Vol 7, page 240. See also Ane Breve Cronicle of the Earls of Ross, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; aged about 62.  He and his wife Euphemia, had at least two children; Alexander Leslie, born about 1371, who would succeed as Earl of Ross at the death of his mother was probably under 12 at the death of his father; Lady Margaret (actually Mary/Mariota) Leslie, born about 1365, was the eldest and likely 17, and married to Donald, Lord of the Isles.<br />
				There is confusion regarding the existence of another daughter, named as Mary in the Historical Record of the Family of Leslies&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-1]] Leslie, Charles Joseph; vol 1, page 75. &lt;/ref&gt; and “Lady Mary Leslie, (who must have been born about 1368) married to Sir David Hamilton”.  That source is incorrect, as an analysis of dates will show, but has been carried forward into the public domain such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_fitz_Walter_of_Cadzow David fitz Walter of Cadzow]. The Scots Peerage&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-3]] Balfour Paul, Ed 1904; vol 4, page 342. &lt;/ref&gt; records the individual as “David fitz Walter fitz Gilbert” and more accurately suggests “the name of his wife has not been ascertained. He is said to have married a daughter of an Earl of Ross, but there is no corroborative evidence.” He is known to have died before 1378 and had five children before his death. His eldest son, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hamilton_of_Cadzow David Hamilton of Cadzow] is thought to have been born about 1333 and was certainly of age when his father died.  If this marriage occurred the lady could not have been a daughter of Walter Leslie and Euphemia, who married around 1362, and was more likely a sister to William, 5th Earl of Ross.<br />
				Walter Leslie never used the title to the Earldom during his life and neither did his wife although he was called that by others, in particular Charles V of France during the Charter of pension. The reasons for this are unknown. After his death, and only after her divorce to Sir Alexander Stewart, Euphemia will use the title as Countess once, and that in a Charter of 1394.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-3]] Balfour Paul, Ed 1904; vol 7, page 240.  See also Rose of Kilravock, page 123.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				Margaret, in the Historical Record of the Leslies, but really Mary or Mariota, was the eldest daughter and, under the Charter of 1370, important should the line of her brother fail – which it did.  She married Donald, Lord of the Isles but the date of this marriage is, in itself, subject of some conjecture.  Mackenzie in his work on the Clan Donald&lt;ref&gt;History of Macdonalds and Lords of the Isles; Mackenzie, page 72.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests there was a dispensation provided for the marriage between the two families that was dated 1367.  In the work by Skene “The Highlanders of Scotland”, Ed 2, page 219, he states, in relating to events after the death of John, Lord of the Isles, in 1386, that Donald “the eldest son of the second marriage of John, lord of the Isles, [a marriage] with Mary, sister of Alexander, earl of Ross.”<br />
				This lady could not have been born before 1362 but was known to be alive in October 1370 although young.  Mackenzie, mentioned above, informs us that a dispensation for marriage was sought in 1367 when Mary must have been about 5.  This arrangement must therefore have been made as part of the deal around the Papal dispensation to continue the marriage, of Walter Leslie and Euphemia Ross, in 1367.  Skene advises that the marriage occurred in 1386, after the death of John, Lord of the Isles and father to Donald.  This seems improbable as Euphemia was forced to marry [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stewart,_Earl_of_Buchan Alexander Stewart, Lord of Lochaber] in June 1382 and he was looking for a marriage for his illegitimate son, John, and would have married them quickly if he could have.  Thus it seems most probable that Mary and Donald married in the period after Leslie's death in February 1382 and Euphemia's forced marriage to Alexander Stewart in June 1382.
