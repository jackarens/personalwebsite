				{{Magna Carta}} &lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;Roger is the son of [[Quincy-226| Saher de Quincy]], a Magna Carta surety baron&lt;/center&gt; [[Category:Quincy-226 Descendants]][[Category: Knights bachelor]]
				</p>
				<p>
				== Biography ==<br />
				: Wives: Helen of Galloway, Maud de Bohun and Eleanor Ferrers. Children: Helen, Elisabeth and Margaret (all with Helen of Galloway).<br />
				: "He probably joined his father on the Fifth Crusade in 1219, where the elder de Quincy fell sick and died. His elder brother having died a few years earlier, Roger thus inherited his father's titles and properties. However, he did not take possession of his father's lands until February 1221, probably because he did not return to England from the crusade until then. He did not formally become earl until after the death of his mother in 1235."&lt;ref&gt;''Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester'' Wkipedia&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				: Roger married Helen, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Alan, Lord of Galloway. Without legitimate sons to succeed him, Alan's lands and dignities were divided between the husbands of his three daughters, so Roger acquired Alan's position as Constable of Scotland, and one-third of the lordship of Galloway (although the actual title of Lord of Galloway went through Helen's half-sister Devorguilla to her husband John I de Balliol).<br />
				: In the following years Roger was one of the leaders of the baronial opposition to Henry III of England, although he fought for Henry against the Welsh in the 1250s and 1260s.<br />
				: "In the parliament of Oxford of 1258 he was one of the twelve elected by the ‘community’ to attend the three annual parliaments and exercise the rights of parliament. He was further elected one of the twenty-four commissioners to treat of aid to the king (Annals of Burton, i. 449–50), &lt;ref&gt;''Royal Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families'' page 447&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the witnesses to the king's confirmation of the acts of the council (ib. p. 456). When Richard of Cornwall was returning from Germany early in 1259, Earl Roger, in company with Walter, bishop of Worcester, and others, on behalf of the barons met him at St. Omer, and forbade him to cross over to England until he had sworn to observe the provisions of Oxford. After eleven days of dispute they obtained a satisfactory guarantee (Wykes, iv. 121–2)." &lt;ref&gt;''Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester'' Wikisource paragraph 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; <br />
				: Thus Roger, 2nd Earl of Winchester, followed in the footsteps of his father, Saer de Quincy, who was one of the twenty-five Barons who were elected surety for Magna Carta in 1215.<br />
				: Roger's wife Ellen (or Helen) of Galloway died after 21 November 1245, and was buried at Brackely, Northamptonshire, England.&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families'' page 446&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				: "Following Helen's death in 1245, Roger married Maud de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, around 1250. Maud died only two years later, and Roger married his third wife, Eleanor Ferrers, daughter of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby the same year. After his death his estates were divided between the daughters, and the earldom of Winchester lapsed." &lt;ref&gt; ''Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester'' Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

				The arms of Roger de Quincy are described as "Gules, seven mascules conjoined, three, three, and one, or."  (A.C. Fox-Davies:  A Complete Guide to Heraldry, London, 1909)  These are the same arms claimed by the Quincys of Massachusetts.: Professor Salisbury (Family Memorials, 1885, page 308) reports that Roger de Quincy assumed the device of the seven mascules, and goes on to explain that "it appears that the descendants of the younger sons of Saher de Quincy were very numerous, and, as the lands and property were divided, they went into different employments, and became part of the yeomanry of England, but yet carefully retained the arms, and the tradition of their Norman descent."  This may explain the use of this device by the Quincys of Massachusetts to this day.<br />
				According to Richard Thomson, An Historical Essay on the Magna Charta of King John (London, 1829)  page 251, these arms were borne by Ferrers of Groby; who were descendants of William de Ferrers, a younger son of Margaret de Quincy and William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby (see below).<br />
				Roger married Helen of Galloway (died after November 21, 1245).  Helen was a daughter of Alan of Galloway, Lord of Galloway, High Constable of Scotland and Advisor to King John (died in 1234) and a daughter or sister of Roger de Lacy, of Pontefract, Constable of Chester. Note:  Alan of Galloway had a second marriage to and additional children by Margaret de Huntingdon, a great granddaughter of David (I) "The Saint", King of Scotland. See MC 139 &amp; 140.<br />
				Roger and Helen had the following daughters, among whom his lands were divided:<br />
				Margaret de Quincy who married circa 1238 to William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby, as his second wife, her step-mother's father. MC 88-3, CP XII/2 pg. 753::NOTE:  Roger de Quincy's third wife, Eleanor de Ferrers, was the daughter of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby, by his first wife Sybil Marshal the daughter of William Marshal. Roger married Eleanor Ferrers about fourteen years after Roger's daughter Margaret Quincy by his first wife, Helen Galloway married William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby.&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families'' Vol. II, page 412-415 and Vol. II, page 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

				BURIAL: Brackley, Northamptonshire, England<br />
				2nd Earl of Winchester, Constable of Scotland.<br />
				Roger de Quincy (his elder brother, Robert, being still in the Holy Land), had livery of his father's estates and he subsequently s. to the Earldom of Winchester. This nobleman marrying Helen, eldest dau. and co-heir of Alan, Lord of Galloway, became, in her right, constable of Scotland. By this lady he had issue, Margaret, Elizabeth, and Ela, m. to Alan, Lord Zouch, of Ashby.<br />
				His lordship m. 2ndly, Maud, dau. of Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford (widow of Anselme Mareschall, Earl of Pembroke).<br />
				Roger married 3rdly, Alianore, dau. of William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby, and widow of William de Vaux (this lady survived the earl and m. after his decease, Roger de Leybourne). Dugdale says that the earl had another dau., but by which wife he could not discover, namely, Isabell, with whom a contract of marriage was made, by John, son of Hugh de Nevil, for his son, Hugh.<br />
				His lordship d. in 1264, when the Earldom of Winchester became extinct, and his great landed possessions devolved upon his daughters, as co-heiresses.<br />
				Roger took part in the Baronial Wars with his father and accompanied him on Crusade in 1219. He served in Henry III's army in Poitou. His too strict rule of Galloway incited a revolt in 1247. His castle was besieged and deciding to make a dash for it rather than starve to death, he mounted his horse and bolted through the gates with a few followers. They cut their way through the enemy lines and rode all the way to the Scottish court, where King Alexander came to his aid, punished the rebels and restored the Earl's authority.

				Saire - 1st Earl of Winchester.<br />
				Was a Baron present at Lincoln when William the Lion of Scotland did homage to the English monarch in October 1200. He obtained large grants and immunities from King John and was created Earl of Winchester, 2 March 1207, having been governor in 1203 of the Castle of Ruil in Normandy. He is created with rewriting Magna Charta from the Charter of King Henry I and the Saxon Code. Because he had opposed the Kings concession to the Popes legate, he was bitterly hated by King John. One of the Barons to whom the City and Tower of London were resigned, Saire de Quincey was excommunicated with the other Barons the following year.<br />
				He was sent, with Robert Fitzwalter, the Surety, by the other Barons, to invite the Dauphin of France to assume the Crown of England and, even after the death of King John, he kept a strong garrison in Montsorell Castle in behalf of Prince Louis. When the Barons, being greatly outnumbered, were defeated by the troops of King Henry III, Saire de Quincey, with many others, was made prisoner and his estates forfeited. In the following October his immense estates were restored upon his submission. In 1218 the Earl of Winchester went with the Earls of Chester and Arundel to the Holy Land, assisted at the siege of Damietta in 1219, and died 3 November in the same year, on the way to Jerusalem.<br />

				Roger of Quincy<br />
				Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester (1195? - April 25, 1265) was a medieval nobleman who was prominent on both sides of the Anglo-Scottish border, as Earl of Winchester and Constable of Scotland. He was the second son of Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester, and Margaret de Beaumont.<br />
				He probably joined his father on the Fifth Crusade in 1219, where the elder de Quincy fell sick and died. His elder brother having died a few years earlier, Roger thus inherited his father's titles and properties. However, he did not take possession of his father's lands until February 1221, probably because he did not return to England from the crusade until then. He did not formally become earl until after the death of his mother in 1235.<br />
				Roger married Helen, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Alan, Lord of Galloway. Without legitimate sons to succeed him, Alan's lands and dignities were divided between the husbands of his three daughters, so Roger acquired Alan's position as Constable of Scotland, and one-third of the lordship of Galloway (although the actual title of Lord of Galloway went through Helen's half-sister Devorguilla to her husband John I de Balliol).<br />
				The Galwegians rebelled under Gille Ruadh, not wanting their land divided, but the rebellion was suppressed by Alexander II of Scotland. Roger ruled his portion of Galloway strictly, and the Galwegians revolted again in 1247, forcing Roger to take refuge in a castle. Faced with a siege and little chance of relief, Roger and a few men fought their way out and rode off to seek help from Alexander, who raised forces to again suppress the rebellion.<br />
				In the following years Roger was one of the leaders of the baronial opposition to Henry III of England, although he fought for Henry against the Welsh in the 1250s and 1260s.<br />
				Following Helen's death in 1245, Roger married Maud de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, around 1250. Maud died only two years later, and Roger married his third wife, Eleanor Ferrers, daughter of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby the same year.<br />
				Roger had three daughters by his first wife, but no sons. His subsequent marriages produced no issue. After his death his estates were divided between the daughters, and the earldom of Winchester lapsed. The three daughters of Roger and Helen of Galloway were:<br />
				Helen (also known as Ela or Elena), who married Alan Baron Zouche of Ashby;<br />
				Elizabeth (also known as Isabella), who married Alexander Comyn, 2nd Earl of Buchan;<br />
				Margaret, who married William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby (and was thus stepmother to her own stepmother).
