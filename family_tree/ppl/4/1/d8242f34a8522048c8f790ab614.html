				{{British Isles 742-1499}}<br />
				== Biography =="Gilbert married Margery, daughter of Hugh de Eland of Eland and Rochdale, who gave Gilbert in frank marriage with his daughter, certain lands in Naden in Spotland (H'halley Couchcr, p. 64o). Gilbert also purchased from Robert de Mitton certain lands which had been bestowed upon Jordan de Mitton (the said Robert's grandfather), early in the reign of Henry II., by Hugh de Eland, in frank marriage with his daughter Wymark, viz., two oxgangs of land in Wardleworth, and two oxgangs in Heley (Whalley Coucher, pp. 623, 627). This land afterwards became the nucleus of the Byron estates in the lordship of Rochdale.<br />
				"Gilbert de Barton granted land as an appurtenance of Monton to Geoffrey de Byron, the bounds beginning at Gildenhaleford, following the hedge of Eccles as far as the monks' gate, across Westslack to the brook by Torthalen, and along the brook to Caldebrook and up this to Denebrook.<br />
				"It is evident from several facts, 혰e.g. that the Abbot of Cockersand held Westhoughton as one oxgang by the service of the fortieth part of a knight's fee혰that the original fee of Barton was of eighty oxgangs or ten plough-lands. Of this a fourth part had been alienated before 1212; possibly, as above suggested, one ploughland in Aspull, one in Turton and half in Brockholes. Of the remainder three oxgangs may have been given in alms, so that seventeen oxgangs were responsible for the service of half a knight's fee, instead of the original twenty. Of these seventeen, four must have been sold, so that Gilbert de Barton was liable only for the service from thirteen.<br />
				"At Easter 1250 the complaint was renewed, but with respect to the thirteen oxgangs only혰the rest may have been sold혰and 4s. 1d. for sake fee; but Thomas Grelley further alleged that Gilbert had granted to his daughter, then only eight years of age, a moiety of the tenement. Gilbert was adjudged in the wrong; Cur. Reg. R. 139, m. 9; 140, m. 7; Final Conc. i, 117.<br />
				"There seems to be no record of Gilbert's sale of the lordship, which is inferred from the later history.
				</p>
				<p>
				"Gilbert de Barton was a benefactor of Stanlaw; Whalley Couch. i, 50.<br />
				"He died in or before 1275, when inquiry was made if he had held four messuages and certain lands, 6s. 8d. rent, and two parts of a mill in Barton, then in the possession of Robert Grelley; a fine was made by which Robert's right was acknowledged and he granted certain lands to Gilbert's son John de Barton and his heirs; Assize R. 1235, m. 11. This grant included Salteye, half of Boysnope and land between the Irwell and Chat Moss; Copped Greave, Deep Lache, Derboch, and the Hay are mentioned among the bounds."
				</p>
				<p>
				--------He succeeded to the manor of Barton.  (Gilbert was a minor at the death of his grandmother (he was her heir) in 1220, but had livery of his lands two years later; he adopted Barton as a surname and was made a knight. On 26 Jan 1222, a mandate was given to the Sheriff of Lancaster to give to Gilbert, described as nepos et heres of Edith de Barton, livery of 32 oxgangs of land with the appurtenances in Barton [cum membris], which he ought to hold of the King in socage, and for which he had fined for his relief by ten marks, and had done homage (Fine Roll, 6 Hen. III., m. 7). He held the remainder of his estates in Barton cum membris by military service, of Robert Grelley, lord of Manchester.<br />
				Sir Gilbert de Barton granted to Agnes, his 'daughter and heir,' for her marriage, a moiety of the vill of Barton in homages and services, of Dumplington and Hulme in demesnes and services, of Irlam, &amp;c., in services; Dods. MSS. cxlix, fol. 150. He granted her wardship to Sir John de Blackburn, and she was to be married to his eldest son and heir; ibid. 150b. Sir John, however, released to Sir Thomas Grelley the said wardship and marriage; ibid.<br />
				He fell into the hands of Aaron, the Jew of York, (fn. 26)  and parted with large portions of his lands, (fn. 27) and finally sold his great lordship to Robert Grelley his feudal superior. (fn. 28)  This sale was confirmed by his son John. (fn. 29)  Gilbert retained or regained the manor of Barton, but this was given to his daughter Agnes, (fn. 30) perhaps in view of her marriage with a Grelley, (fn. 31)  and her daughter and heir Loretta by marriage with John del Booth, about 1292, carried it into a family which, as Booth of Barton, retained it for 300 years.<br />
				26 - He sold the advowson of Eccles before 1234 to John de Lacy, because of an acquittance to Aaron the Jew of York which Lacy had made; Whalley Couch. i, 41. Aaron son of Joseus the Jew of York refeoffed Sir Gilbert de Barton of the manor of Barton, with remainder to John son of Sir Gilbert, and to Agnes the daughter; Dods. MSS. clxix, fol. 154b.  Geoffrey de Chetham assigned to Sir Thomas Grelley the land and rent demised to him by Aaron, to hold until 205 marks should be paid to Sir Thomas, either by the grantor or by Gilbert de Barton; ibid. fol. 153b.<br />
				27 - To Thomas Grelley he sold, at different times, all his right in Westwood, 3 oxgangs of land held by Agnes widow of Geoffrey de Worsley and by Adam de Bowdon, 3 oxgangs of land held by Adam and Thomas de Hulme, 20 oxgangs of land held by Adam son of Wronow de Wardley, an orchard called the Imp Yard, and other lands; De Trafford D. no. 188혯97. To one of these deeds is appended the seal of Gilbert de Notton, showing a pile; to another Gilbert de Barton's own seal, paly of four.  <br />
				Gilbert de Barton in 1235 granted to Richard de Bracebridge 3 oxgangs of land in Brinsop in return for a release of all claims on the Barton fee; Final Conc. (Rec. Soc. Lancs. and Ches.) i, 62. In 1241 for a similar release he sold 4 oxgangs of land in Heaton to Richard son of Christiana de Allerton혰 probably Richard de Hulton; ibid. i, 88.<br />
				28 - In 1242 Gilbert de Barton held a knight's fee and a half of Thomas Grelley, and Thomas held of the Earl of Ferrers, and he in chief of the king; Lancs. Inq.a nd Extents, i, 153. In 1246 ThomasGrelley claimed from Gilbert de Barton the customs and services due in respect of the fee of a knight and also in respect of 13 oxgangs of land where 17 oxgangs made half a knight's fee; that he should do suit at the court of Manchester from three weeks to three weeks, and render 14s. 8d.a year as sake fee and castle ward. Gilbert undertook to do this, and promised not to grant, sell, mortgage or alienate the said tenement in Barton in the future without the licence of Thomas Grelley or his heirs; Final Conc. i, 93.<br />
				29 - Whalley Couch. iii, 881. John de Barton in this as in other deeds is described as 'son and heir' of Sir Gilbert, though Agnes is called 'daughter and heir.' The Barton fee released to Robert Grelley (who died in 1282) comprised, in addition to Barton proper, the whole or parts of Aspull, Brinsop, Westhoughton, Hulton, Halliwell, Breightmet, Farnworth, Northdene, Eccles, Monton, Worsley, Westwood, Winton, Newham, Irlam, Bromyhurst, Davyhulme, Dumplington, Whittleswick, and Crompton with Belemoor. These were held by various tenures; the knight's fee and a half held of the barony of Manchester is supposed to have been originally constituted as follows: Barton, Eccles, Dumplington, Farnworth, Westhoughton, Brinsop, Aspull, and Heaton under Horwich혰one fee; and Irlam, Davyhulme, Bromyhurst, Newham, Winton, Monton, and Whittleswick 혰 half a fee; Lancs. Inq. and Extents, i, 54; Mamecestre, ii, 379, where eight oxgangs of land in the last-named hamlets and in Barton are said to have rendered the service for the half-fee in 1322.<br />
				By another charter John son and heir of Sir Gilbert de Barton granted to Robert Grelley the services of David de Hulton, Roger de Pendlebury, Richard de Urmston, Robert de Hulton, Germain de Newham, Richard de Winton, Roger de Eccles (chaplain), William de Eccles (clerk), Iarfrid de Barton, Ellis de Barton, William son of Stephen de Barton, Thomas son of Adam de Hulme, Adam son of Thomas de Hulme, Alexander the Mey, Robert de Birches, John son of Ralph the Ferryman, Adam son of Henry de Irlam and John de Bromyhurst;  DeTrafford D. no. 201. In the same collection (202혯205) are the charter cited above from the Whalley Couch. and others connected with the transfer. In 1302 John de Barton released to Thomas Grelley all his claim arising from the withdrawal, after the death of Sir Robert Grelley, of a robe of the suit of his esquires and of maintenance for a groom and horse; Dods. MSS. cxlix, fol. 151.<br />
				Sir Gilbert had a brother William, who died without issue; Duchy of Lanc. Assize R. 6, m. 2d. (Sept. 1357); yet two years earlier (1355) John de Barton had claimed a messuage and lands against Richard son of William de Barton; ibid.R. 4, m. 5.<br />
				30 - Sir Gilbert de Barton granted to Agnes, his 'daughter and heir,' for her marriage a moiety of the vill of Barton in homages and services, of Dumplington and Hulme in demesnes and services, of Irlam, &amp;c., in services; Dods. MSS. cxlix, fol. 150. He granted her wardship to Sir John de Blackburn, and she was to be married to his eldest son and heir; ibid. 150b. Sir John, however, release dto Sir Thomas Grelley the said wardship and marriage; ibid.<br />
				There was another daughter Alice, who made grants of land near Boysnope; DeTrafford D. no. 206혯09;  also a daughter Amery; Assize R. 408, m. 16.<br />
				31 - It appears that Agnes was married to John Grelley, whose place in the Grelley pedigree is unknown; for Loretta, daughter of John Grelley, was in 1292 a plaintiff in a Barton case; Assize R. 408,m. 4 d. Agnes, as daughter of Gilbert de Barton, was plaintiff from 1275 onwards in various suits respecting the manor. Against Peter Grelley, uncle of Robert, she sought half the manor in 1275, and next year demanded two-thirds, or two thirds of a moiety, against Robert Grelley; De Banco R. 7, m. 21; 13, m. 3; 17,m. 25d. Cecily, the widow of Gilbert de Barton, had the other third; ibid. R. 33, m. 48; see De Trafford D. no. 199, 200.<br />
				Agnes may have married, secondly, Alexander le Mey of Bromyhurst; Alexander and his wife Agnes in 1277 granted to the former's son Alexander a messuage and two parts of an oxgang of land in Barton, to be held of the heirs of Agnes; Final Conc. i, 152. If so, she was living, a widow, in 1292; Assize R. 408, m. 32,3 d. The Mey family long continued to hold lands in Barton.<br />
				There was another daughter Alice, who made grants of land near Boysnope; De Trafford D. no. 206혯09; also a daughter Amery; Assize R. 408, m. 16.
