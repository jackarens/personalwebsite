				: : Beatrice of ProvenceQueen Consort of SicilyTenure26 February, 1266-23 September, 1267 SpouseCharles I of SicilyIssueBlanche, Countess of Flanders<br />
				: Beatrice, Emperess of Constantinople<br />
				: Charles II of Naples<br />
				: Philippe, Prince of Achaïea<br />
				: Elisabeth, Queen of HungaryHouseHouse of Aragon (by birth): House of Anjou (by marriage)FatherRaymond Berenguer IV of ProvenceMotherBeatrice of SavoyBornc.1234<br />
				: Died23 September 1267 (aged 32-33)<br />
				: : Beatrice of Provence (c.1234-23 September 1267, Nocera Inferiore) was the first wife and Queen consort of Charles I of Sicily.<br />
				: : The youngest daughter of Raymond Berenguer IV of Provence and Beatrice of Savoy, Beatrice was married on January 31, 1246 to Charles of France, Count of Anjou and Maine, the youngest brother of King Louis IX of France.<br />
				: <br />
				: Family: Raymond Berenguer, the Count of Provence and Forcalquier, had four daughters, but no sons. His eldest daughter, Marguerite, had married King Louis IX of France and was Queen consort of France; his second daughter, Eleanor, had married King Henry III of England, and his third, Sanchia, had married the wealthy Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother of King Henry. King Louis IX's marriage to Marguerite had been arranged by his mother, Blanche of Castile, with the hopes that he would inherit Provence and Forcalquier when Berenguer died. Berenguer, however, left everything to Beatrice. James I of Aragon, in the hopes of uniting Provence and Toulouse, had planned to marry Beatrice but when her father died the French court intervened, by getting the Pope to refuse the marriage.<br />
				: <br />
				: Marriage: When Berenguer had died on August 19, 1245, Beatrice became one of the most attractive heiresses in medieval Europe. Various suitors had tried to seize her, so her mother, Beatrice of Savoy, placed the younger Beatrice in a safe fortress, secured the trust of its people then went to the Pope for his protection. In Cluny during December 1245, a secret discussion, between Pope Innocent IV, Louis IX of France, his mother Blanche of Castile and his brother Charles of Anjou, took place. It was decided that in return for Louis IX supporting the Pope militarily, the Pope would allow Charles of Anjou, youngest brother to the French King, to marry Beatrice of Provence. Provence, however, was to never go to France outright through Charles. It was agreed that if Charles and Beatrice had children, the county would go to them; if there was no issue, then the county would go to Sanchia of Provence. If Sanchia died without an heir, Provence would go to the King of Aragon.<br />
				: : Beatrice of Savoy who had been granted the usufruct of the county for her lifetime according to her husband's will, agreed to the marriage between Charles of Anjou and her youngest daughter, Beatrice. Charles, along with Philippe of Savoy and five hundred knights, rode from Lyon to Provence. On their way, they ran into Raymond VII Count of Toulouse, who also had an army on the way to Provence. However, Raymond of Toulouse had been deceived by knights in favour of Charles and for that reason he had brought fewer men and Charles and his army were quicker. When Charles got to Aix-en-Provence, James I of Aragon, who had been there all along but was not allowed to see Beatrice, had his soldiers surrounding the castle in which the young Beatrice and her mother were. There was a brief struggle, but the King of Aragon retreated with dignity. To the young Beatrice, Charles, who was described as "an admirable young man", was a satisfactory resolution to her problems. The marriage took place in Aix-en-Provence. They had soldiers on guard and the bride was escorted down the aisle by her uncle, Thomas of Savoy.<br />
				: : As soon as Charles became Count of Provence, he brought in his own team of French lawyers and accountants. He excluded his mother in law from the running of the county and began taking castles, power and fees away from the nobles who had previously enjoyed a certain degree of independence in the running of their cities. Charles made himself very unpopular. Beatrice of Savoy moved herself to Forcalquier in protest and in Marseille, Charles's officials were thrown out of the city. In the family conflict the younger Beatrice sided with her husband.<br />
				: : In May 1247, Charles and Beatrice were recorded as being in Melun where Charles was knighted by his brother Louis. Beatrice accompanied Charles on the seventh crusade in 1248. Led by Louis IX, the crusaders made an extended procession through France. Before they left, Charles and Beatrice met with her mother in Beaucaire to try to come to some terms of agreement concerning Provence. Whilst the more important matters were left until Charles and Beatrice returned, it was decided that Beatrice of Savoy would give up the rights to 'the castle at Aix in exchange for a percentage of the county's revenue.'<br />
				: : Beatrice gave birth to her first child in Nicosia, 'a very elegant and wellformed son', which Robert of Artois wrote home to his mother, Blanche of Castile, about. Beatrice stayed with her sister Marguerite in Damietta, when they lost contact with the King and his army, both women gave birth whilst in Damietta. Later in 1250, they were reunited with the rest of the crusade at Acre, were the King's ransom was paid. Charles and Beatrice, along with several other nobles, left soon after. They journeyed to the court of Emporer Frederick II, to ask him to send the King of France more men for his crusade. However, the Emperor, who had been excommunicated, needed his army to fight the Pope, and refused. Charles and Beatrice were then forced to go Lyon to meet with the Pope.<br />
				: : By the time they returned to Provence in 1251, open rebellion had broken out, spurred on by Beatrice's mother, who felt Charles had failed to respect her claims in Provence. However, by July 1252 Charles had managed to deafeat the revolt and was in the process of exercising his power as Count of Provence, when in November of the same year, Blanche of Castile died, and Charles and Beatrice had to go Paris, where Charles co-ruled France with his brother, Alphonse. The Pope offered Charles the Kingdom of Sicily in 1252, but Charles had to turn the offer down, as he was preoccupied with other affairs and he also did not have sufficient funds.<br />
				: : The crusade returned in 1254. Charles and Beatrice spent Christmas in Paris that year, where all of Beatrice's sisters and their mother were present, it was noted that the other four women treated the younger Beatrice coldly, due to Raymond Berenguer's will.<br />
				: : Marguerite, the Queen of France and Beatrice's sister, publicly offended her in 1259, by not seating her at the family table; she claimed because Beatrice was not a Queen like her sisters, she could not sit with them. Marguerite had hoped to provoke her sister in treacherous behaviour so she would have a valid reason to invade Provence. Beatrice "with great grief", went to Charles and he reportedly told her " Be at peace, for I will shortly make thee a greater Queen than them".<br />
				: : When the new Pope granted Charles the Kingdom of Sicily, all he had to do was deafeat Manfred of Sicily. Another contender to win the throne of Sicily was Beatrice's nephew, Edmund Crouchback, but it soon became clear that Charles was the more promising candidate. In order to achieve his goal, Charles needed an army and Beatrice helped her husband raise one. She called on all her knights as well as the young men of France, and she pledged all her jewels, to make sure they joined her husbands army.<br />
				: : "Beatrice, to aid him (Charles) in the gratification of her ambition, sold all her jewels and personal ornaments, and expended her private treasure in collecting round her standard, not only her own vassals, but the chivalric youth of France , who were attracted to her service not less by her personal solicitations than by her rich gifts." Angelo da Constanzo<br />
				: : Charles went first to Rome, and Beatrice followed with the remaining army through the treacherous Alpine passes, during Autumn. It took them nearly six weeks to reach Rome, but once both Charles and Beatrice were in Rome, they were crowned King and Queen consort of Sicily, on 6 January 1266 .As soon as the coronation festivities had ended, Beatrice stayed in Rome with a small force to hold the city, whilst Charles rode out to the battle of Benevento. After her husbands victory, she chose the castle Melfi as their residence.<br />
				: <br />
				: Issue<br />
				: Charles and Beatrice had the following children:<br />
				: <br />
				: Louis (1248-1248 Nicosia): Blanche (1250- July 1269), married in 1265 Robert III of Flanders (1249-1322), by whom she had a son, Charles who died young.: Beatrice of Sicily (1252-1275), married in 1273 Philip of Courtenay (1243-1283), titular emperor of Constantinople, by whom she had one daughter, Catherine I of Courtenay, titular Empress of Constantinople.: Charles II of Naples (1254-1309), Count of Anjou and of Provence, King of Naples, married Maria Arpad of Hungary, by whom he had issue. English Queen consort Philippa of Hainaut descended from their daughter, Marguerite of Anjou and Maine.: Philippe (1256-1 January 1277)titular King of Thessalonica from 1274, prince of Achaïea, married in 1271 Isabella of Villehardouin (1263-1312), princess of Achaïea and Morea<br />
				: Robert (1258-1265): Élisabeth (1261-1300), married to Ladislaus IV of Hungary (1262-1290). Their marriage was childless.<br />
				: Death: Beatrice died in 1267, a little over a year after becoming Queen. The cause of her death was not recorded. She was initially buried at Nocera, but Charles later moved her body to Aix-en-Provence were she was laid to rest with her father.<br />
				: : Beatrice, like her sisters, mother and grandmother was known for her beauty. A description of Beatrice said she "set men's hearts thumping and the fingers of troubadours to fevered twanging of lyres. Two of the balladists at the Provencal court were temporarily deprived of reason for love of the entrancing Beatrice", and like her sister Sanchia, she would eventually become a Queen before her death: Sanchia became 'Queen of the Romans' after the Earl of Cornwall was elected as King; Beatrice became Queen consort of Sicily, after that realm was bestowed upon Charles by the Pope.<br />
