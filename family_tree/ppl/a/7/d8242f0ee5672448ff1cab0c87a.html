				== Biography ==This Profile relates to the Sir Alexander Seton, defender of Berwick in 1333 and later Master of Torphichen, Knight of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.  The person of this Profile married, c. 1311, Christian Cheyne, daughter of Cheyne of Straloch, Aberdeenshire.  Please take care with merging profiles in this line and seek advice from Profile Managers if in doubt.  Alexander was a very common name in the family.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Conjecture with Parents===The details of his parents are in doubt and is discussed in The Scots Peerage, by Balfour Paul.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/562/mode/2up page 563]&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, Maitland and Douglas show him as a grandson, and Nisbet, Crawfurd, Lord Hailes and Wood as son (by Christiana de Brus, sister of King Robert I.) of Sir Christopher Seton, who is stated, by all sources to have been the head of the house of Seton in Scotland at the time of the rise of Robert Bruce.  Sir Bruce Gordon Seton&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] Sir Bruce Gordon Seton; [https://archive.org/stream/houseofsetonstv100seto#page/84/mode/2up page 85]&lt;/ref&gt; however, provides greater clarity in the discussion stating that as Sir Christopher Seton only came of age in 1299 he could not have been either grandfather or father to this Alexander who was, himself, of age in 1296.  Wikitree will follow the genealogy provided in Sir Bruce Gordon Seton's work.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Life Events===There is a lack of clarity regarding events prior to 1306.  It is highly probable that it is he noted as Alisaundre de Seton, Vallet, del Counte de Edeneburgh, in the Ragman Rolls of 1296.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/564/mode/2up page 565]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				In 1306 he is noted as being in the Isles, tasked by Edward I., with John de Mowbray, but Balfour Paul notes that he must have fallen under some suspicion, as a royal order directed that he was to be seized and sent to the King on his return, and that his goods and chattels should be forfeited.  There is a plea for his lands on 8 August that year.  In Oct of that year he is noticed as a prisoner in York castle.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of Documents Relating to Scotland; Bain; [http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/source/8731/# v., 471c]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				In 1308, he was certainly aligned with Bruce.  It is likely him with Bruce at Cambuskenneth where Sir Alexander de Seton, Sir Gilbert Hay and Sir Neil Campbell swore to defend King Robert Bruce's right to the Crown.<br />
				On 20 February 1312, he was back in service of the English and served as a juror at an inquisition taken before the English Sheriff of Lothian concerning the value of the lands of several local proprietors who had joined the national party.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of Documents Relating to Scotland; Bain; [http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/source/7831/# iii., 245]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				In 1314 he was noted as being in the Army of the English in preparation for Bannockburn.  Sir Thomas Gray of Heton, in the work Scalacronica,&lt;ref&gt;Scalacronica; Sir Thomas Gray; [https://archive.org/stream/scalacronica00unkngoog#page/n232/mode/2up page 142]&lt;/ref&gt; notes that on the night before the battle (24 June 1314) he went over to Bruce and assured him that, the English demoralised, an attack the next day would be successful.  To add credibility to this story the father of the author was in the Scottish camp as prisoner at the time.<br />
				Between 1315 and 1317 he was with Edward Bruce in his campaigns in Ireland.  His lands appear to have been forfeit in 1319 and in the hands of the Crown (Edward II.).  He was at the English Court in 1320 as an Ambassador.<br />
				In 1320, 6 April, he was one of the signatories to the Baron's letter, Declaration of Arbroath, to Pope John XXII..
				</p>
				<p>
				===Lands===He had charters of the superiority of the lands of Elphinstone, of the commonty of Travernent which was the Earl of Buchan's, of a tenement in Aberdeen, of the lands of Barnes (said to have been granted along with the augmentation of the double tressure to his coat of arms), of Gogar, of the superiority of Dundas, Westercraigs and part of Queensferry, of the barony of Travernent which William Ferraris forfeited, of the lands of Fausyde which Alan La Suche forfeited, of the lands of Mylyis which the Earl of Buchan forfeited; and a charter of confirmation of the lands of Halsington, co. Berwick.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/566/mode/2up page 566]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				He had also charters of the lands in Travernent and husband-lands in Nodref which pertained to the deceased Alan La Suche, of lands in Nidriffe in the barony of Winchburgh, of the lands of Hertsheved, and in 1328, charter of resignation of the barony of Lambyngston, co. Lanark.  <br />
				He had charters of the lands and town of Seaton in ane burgh of barony, and of the lands and barony of Seatoun erected into a free barony; and grants of liberty of market on every Lord's day after Mass, of the town of Seton in free burgage with all liberties etc., and of the lands of Setone in free warren and forest for ever.  He is designate Sir Alexander de Seton, the father, Lord of that Ilk, in a charter granted by Alanus de Hertesheued, attributed to a date c. 1328.  His son, Alexander, thus being of age and having been knighted the year prior.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/566/mode/2up page 567]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				He held the town of Berwick in feu-farm before January 1328, when he was appointed Governor of the town, the Earl of March being Governor of the castle.<br />
				He was, for a time, Steward of the Household of David, Earl of Carrick, Prince of Scotland.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Siege of Berwick 1333===He remained Governor of the castle at Berwick and was there in March to June 1333 when he commanded the defences against Balliol and Edward III..  He was replaced by Sir William Keith who appears as the commander at the surrender in July 1333.  While Commander he is said to have watched his son, Thomas, being executed.  Another son, William, was also killed at the siege having drowned while attempting to fire the English ships firing on Berwick.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Later Service===His lands were again forfeit in 1334.  He appears as  a witness in a Charter, of the Earldom of Berwick, to Edward III on 9 February 1334,&lt;ref&gt;The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2015), [http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1334/4 1334/4]. &lt;/ref&gt; and in Balliol's Parliament later that year&lt;ref&gt;The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2015), [http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/A1334/9 A1334/9]. &lt;/ref&gt; but it is unlikely he ever recovered his lands as they were still held by William of Eylesford in 1336.<br />
				In 1341, he, designed as Alexander de Setoun, Lord of that Ilk, was one of the Lords Auditors of Causes and Complaints, Adam de Moray being the other.&lt;ref&gt;The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2015), [http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1341/6 1341/6]. &lt;/ref&gt;
				</p>

				===Order of the Knights of Saint John===<br />
				{{Image|file=Doug_s_Photos-17.png<br />

				}} It seems that, shortly after 1341, he joined the Knights Hospitaller.  He had been appointed, some time prior to 1345, to the charge of the House of Torphichen by the Grand Master at Rhodes.<br />
				The Rules of the Order demanded that he hold no estates and no family.  It must be supposed that his wife had died by this point and that he had passed his principal estates to his heir, who must have been either Alexander or John.  He was however observed as Dominus ejusdem (Lord of that Ilk or Lord of lands of that name) in 1345, when, as Master of Torphichen, he granted a charter to William de Meldrum.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/568/mode/2up page 568]&lt;/ref&gt;  This may have been the time he became Master of the Order.<br />
				He was still with the Order on 6 February 1347 when he obtained an indult from Pope Clement VI. permitting him to choose a confessor and on 12 August 1348 when he had a safe-conduct to enable him to visit King David II. in the Tower of London.  On the latter occassion he is styled "Prater Alexander de Seton, Miles, Hospitalis S. Johannis Jerusalem".<br />
				He seems to have died shortly afterwards and likely in 1349 as he no longer appear on any record.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/568/mode/2up page 568]&lt;/ref&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===Family===Sir Alexander Seton is said, by Maitland and others, to have married Christian Cheyne, daughter of the Laird of Straloch.  According to Sir Bruce Gordon Seton&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] Sir Bruce Gordon Seton; [https://archive.org/stream/houseofsetonstv100seto#page/94/mode/2up page 95]&lt;/ref&gt; this event occurred in 1311 but this must be an error.  The youngest son, John is known to have married and had a son, Alexander, that married in 1346.  Thus it would seem likely that the marriage occurred closer to 1300.   They had four sons:<br />
				: Thomas Seton, who was hanged by order of King Edward III. when a hostage during the siege of Berwick in 1333. He is not known to have married.<br />
				: William Seton, who was drowned in the Tweed while engaged in setting fire to some of the enemy's ships at the same siege.  He is not known to have married.<br />
				: Alexander Seton, who appears to have been knighted.  He was probably the Sir Alexander de Seton who was sent on a mission to Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1323, and styled by King Robert I. his 'bachelor'.  He was killed at Kinghorn in Fife, shortly after Edward Baliol's landing there on 6 August 1332.&lt;ref&gt;This incident is discussed in depth in Balfour Paul where he assesses various manuscript before arriving at the statement in the Scalacronica by Gray who states that he died here.&lt;/ref&gt;  The designation 'Sir Alexander the father' never appears after that date.  He is said, by Maitland and Wynton, to have married a Margaret Murray, sister to William Murray, Captain of Edinburgh castle, but there is some doubt and Sir Bruce Gordon Seton is adamant, but without source, that he married Jean Haliburton, daughter of Sir Thomas Haliburton of Dirleton.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] Sir Bruce Gordon Seton; [https://archive.org/stream/houseofsetonstv100seto#page/96/mode/2up page 96]&lt;/ref&gt;  This latter statement must be in error as the Haliburtons did not hold Dirleton at this time. They were held to a family of De Vaux who died in the male line and the lands passed to a John Haliburton c. 1380.  He was the first Haliburton of Dirleton and there never was a Thomas noticed by Balfour Paul.&lt;ref&gt;Although a Thomas Haliburton of Dirleton is noticed in Guthrie's work "A General History of Scotland..." Vol 3; page 197 when working in cooperation with the Earl of Douglas in 1401.  This Thomas was likely a son of Walter Haliburton of Dirleton.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				: John Seton, the youngest but likely the longest living although he is said to have died after 1327 and likely after Berwick.  He was certainly dead prior to 1346 when his son appears as having been the heir.  He is known to have married, although his wife is not named.  He left one son noticed in history:<br />
				:: Alexander Seton; (or Sir Alexander), likely born c. 1325 and is said to have married Margaret de Ruthven, apparently in 1346.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/568/mode/2up page 569]&lt;/ref&gt;  On Easter Sunday, 16 April 1346, at Roxburgh, Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale engaged to make payment to Sir Alexander de Seton, Knight, Lord of that Ilk, in consideration of the marriage of Alexander de Setoun, son of the deceased Sir John de Setoun, Knight, heir of the said Sir Alexander, with Margaret, daughter of the deceased Sir William de Ruthven.  Alexander de Seton seems to have died s.p. soon after his marriage, with Balfour Paul speculating he fell at the Battle of Durham, 17 October 1346.
				</p>
				<p>
				====Notes on Family Matters====Given the conjecture surrounding the family it is worth noting three areas of contention:<br />
				: Alexander Seton, died 1332.  There are a number of sources, sourced to Nisbet and Maitland, that suggest he followed his father and inherited the estates.  The Charter evidence does not support this.  The person of this Profile was certainly still alive after 1335 and the death of Alexander, the younger, at Kinghorn conclusive.  It is possible, although not recorded that Sir Alexander Seton, son to John Seton, inherited from his grandfather when his grandfather joined the Knight Hospitaller.<br />
				: John Seton.  According to Maitland, John Seton, the fourth son, married Elizabeth Ramsay, daughter and heir of Sir Neil Ramsay, Knight, and was, by her, ancestor of the family of Seton of Parbroath, co. Fife.  Balfour Paul did not find any record of such a marriage.  The statement of succession, that is the ancestor of Seton of Parbroath is not possible as it would have been this line and not Margaret that inherited the estates of Seton.<br />
				: The inheritance.  It will be a [[Seton-205|Margaret Seton]] that will inherit.  Her father is unknown.  However the only son known to have married and had children is John Seton.  His son, Alexander, was known to have been the heir to Seton in 1346 at the time of the Charter noticed above.  Margaret was abducted, from the Seton estates, by a subordinate Lord in 1347.  It seems reasonable to assert that Margaret was a sister, likely younger, to Alexander and living on the same estates.
