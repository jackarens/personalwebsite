				== Biography ==<br />
				===Family Matters===Mary Bruce was born in 1630 at Carnock, Fife, Scotland.{{Citation needed}}<br />
				Mary was the youngest daughter of Sir George Bruce of Carnock.&lt;ref name=WMpxiii&gt;[[#WM|Erskine 1893]], pp. xiii-xv&lt;/ref&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				Mary had siblings:<br />
				#Edward Bruce, first Earl of Kincardine;&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;<br />
				#Alexander Bruce, second Earl of Kincardine;&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;#Margaret, married to Sir James Lumsden of Innergellie;&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;<br />
				Mary married [[Erskine-399|David Erskine, second Lord Cardross]] in 1655.&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;  When he married Mary, David had two children from his first marriage in 1645 to Anne Hope&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt; (died in 1653&lt;ref name=JPBp159&gt;[[#JBP|Balfour Paul 1919]], p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;):#[[Erskine-419|Henry Erskine, third Lord Cardross]],&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt; died 21 May, 1693;&lt;ref name=WMpxviii&gt;[[#WM|Erskine 1893]], p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; and#Margaret, who was married to William Cunningham of Boquhan.&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				Mary and David had children:<br />
				#Alexander, died before 1678;&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;#William Erskine of Torry, deputy-governor of Blackness Castle, married to his cousin-german, Magdalen Lumsden of Innergellie, daughter of his mother's sister, Margaret and her husband Sir James;&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;#Hon John Erskine of Carnock, born at Cardross, Perthshire, on 30 March, 1662,&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt; died at Edinburgh on 13 January, 1743,&lt;ref name=WMpxliii&gt;[[#WM|Erskine 1893]], p. xliii&lt;/ref&gt; married 1) 14 March 1690, Jean Mure (died May 1690), eldest daughter of the late William Mure of Caldwell and his wife Barbara Cuninghame, 2) Anna (died 1723&lt;ref name=WMpxli&gt;[[#WM|Erskine 1893]], pp. xli-xlii&lt;/ref&gt;), eldest daughter and a coheir of William Dundas of Kincavil,&lt;ref name=WMpxxviii&gt;[[#WM|Erskine 1893]], p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; 3) in 1725, Lilias Stirling (died 1729), daughter of the laird of Keir and widow of John Murray of Polmaise, and 4) in 1729-30, Mary, the daughter of Chalres Stuart of Dunearn;&lt;ref name=WMpxli /&gt;#Captain Charles Erskine, in the army, died in 1692 at the battle of Steinkirk;&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;#Veronica, who was married in 1703 to Walter Lockhart of Kirktoun, Lanarkshire;&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;#Magdalen, who was married to Alexander Monypenny of Pitmilly, Fifeshire;&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;<br />
				#Mary, died young.&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;<br />
				On 10th July 1671, David, Lord Cardross, executed a Bond of Provision: &lt;blockquote&gt;by the marriage-contract between him and Lady Mary Bruce, his present spouse, he was bound to provide her in liferent, and the bairns of the marriage in fee, to the sum of &amp;pound;68,000, including therein her own tocher, to be divided among the bairns; and also to provide the latter to the half of any free conquest he should acquire during the standing of the marriage: and whereas 'it had pleased God to bless him with seven living and hopeful children of the said marriage,' and considering that the aforesaid sum when divided among them would afford but mean- provisions to each of them, he resolves to add &amp;pound;32,000 thereto, making the sum-total of &amp;pound;100,000, and therefore, with consent of his son Henry, Master of Cardross, he assigns securities of the value aforesaid.&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				David also executed his last will and testament on 10th July 1671, &lt;blockquote&gt;nominating Harie, his eldest son, as only executor; reserving to Lady Mary Bruce, his wife, such plenishing as was provided to her by his bond at the time of their marriage, and bequeathing to her certain silver plate, with all the unshapen linen and woollen cloth, with the yarn, which she had provided ; and nominating as tutors to his children by his said wife, Alexander, Earl of Kincardine ; William, Lord Bellenden ; the said Harie, Master of Cardross ; Sir Charles Erskine of Alva, Sir George Preston of Valleyfield, John Buchanan of that Ilk, Sir William Bruce of Balcaskie, Colonel John Towres, Alexander Bruce of Broomhall, Mr. Robert Preston of that Ilk, George Cockburn of Piltoun, Mr. John Dempster of Pitliver, and the said Lady Mary Bruce.&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
				After the death of their father, David, Lord Cardross, in 1671&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt; and their brother, Alexander, Mary's two oldest surviving children William and Veronica, with consent of their curators, subscribed a declaration in 1678: &lt;blockquote&gt;That on considering their father's Bond of Provision, and that by the decease of their brother Alexander, his portion returned to Henry, now Lord Cardross, so that there remained only the annual rent or interest of 37,800 merks for the maintenance of them and the other children, which, they declare 'will scarce aliment, educate, and furnish us and them in bed, boord and apparel, suitable to our and their station and qualitie: and seing we and the said remanent children have been still entertained and alimented by our and their said mother ever since the decease of the said David, lord Cardross, our father, and that we and they are still with her, therefore, we the said William and Veronica Erskines, with consent aforesaid, do declare that we hereby allocate the said annual rent bygone and to come to our said mother for our aliment, and do approve of her uplifting of the same for that end during our minority ; and that her kindness and motherly piety shown to us should not be prejudicial to her own rights and interests under the aforesaid Bond of provision.''&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
				On 21 February 1683, after William and Veronica reached their majority, the curators "executed an act of division of the balance remaining under the Bond of Provision amounting to 95,429 merks, which they apportioned among the five children now surviving, thus: To William, 40,000 merks; to John, 16,000; to Charles, 12,000; to Veronica, 15,000; to Magdalen, 12,000."&lt;ref name=WMpxiii /&gt; 
				</p>
				<p>
				===Religious Intolerance===Mary lived in Scotland during a time of limited religious freedom.  In 1674, Mary's stepson Henry was fined &amp;pound;5,000 for his wife hearing her own chaplain preach in his own house; he paid &amp;pound;1,000, spent six months at court trying to procure a reprieve from the rest, then spent four years imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle, while his recently repaired and refurnished house at Cardross was abused by the soldiers garrisoned there.  In 1677, his wife had his child baptised by a person not his own parish minister, and Henry, despite being in prison, was again fined.  Sometime after his release, Henry Lord Cardross established a colony in Carolina in North America which was destroyed by the Spaniards.  Henry then attached himself to the friends of liberty in Holland, later accompanying the Prince of Orange to England in 1688, was sworn a privy counsellor, and enjoyed the favour of King William.&lt;ref name=WMpxvii&gt;[[#WM|Erskine 1893]], pp. xvii-xviii&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				In 1684, Mary was fined 4,000 merks "for not going to church."&lt;ref name=WMpxxi&gt;[[#WM|Erskine 1893]], pp. xxi-xxii&lt;/ref&gt;  <br />
				Mary's son John enrolled in law at the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, where, in 1683, he refused "to take the oath affirming the King's supremacy in spiritual as well as civil matters."&lt;ref name=WMpxxi /&gt;  Mary arranged for John to spend that winter getting work experience of legal 'styles' and 'practicks' in the office of Hew Paterson of Bannockburn, Keeper of the Signet.&lt;ref name=WMpxxi /&gt;   On 10 January, 1685, at Leith John boarded a ship for London, with his servant John Law, where he stayed a month, before sailing to Holland where he studied law at the college at Leyden.  John Law was the outed minister of Campsie.&lt;ref name=WMpxxi /&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===Legacy===On 4 April 1693, Mary executed a disposition in favour of her second surviving son, Lieutenant-Colonel John Erskine, lieutenant-govenor of Stirling Castle, (failing his heirs-male to the heirs male of Mr William Erskine, depute-govenor of the garrison of Blackness, her eldest son) of the "plenishing of her house of Torry and other goods and gear," apart from those already given to her other children, Mr William, Veronica, Magdalene and her husband Alexander Monypenny of Pitmilly.  Mary also assigns large sums of money to Mr William, Veronica and Magdalene, with remainder to her son Lieutenant-Colonel John Erskine.  Her four surviving children at this time grant discharge to Mary of her curatory of them and their deceased brother Charles, during their minority.&lt;ref name=WMpxxx&gt;[[#WM|Erskine 1893]], p. xxx&lt;/ref&gt;  <br />
