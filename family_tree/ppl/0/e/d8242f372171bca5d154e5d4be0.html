				: : King Louis VIII "The Lion" Capet (September 5, 1187 - November 8, 1226) reigned as King of France from 1223 to 1226. He was a member of the House of Capet. Louis VIII was born in Paris, France, the son of Philip II Augusta and Isabelle of Hainaut. At the age of 12, Louis was married to Blanche of Castile on 23 May 1200, following prolonged negotiations between Philip Augustus and Blanche's uncle John of England.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Birth and Parentage===<br />
				Louis Capet VIII, King of France "The Lion-heart" was born 5 Sep 1187 in Paris, France and married 23 May 1200 in Pont-Audemer (Beaumont), Normandy. He died 8 Nov 1226 in Montpensier, Auvergne région, France and was buried in Saint Denis Abbey, Seine-Saint-Denis département, Paris région, France. Louis married Blanca de Castilla, Regent of France. &lt;a href="/aqwg20.htm#1636"&gt;[Parents]&lt;/a&gt;<br />
				: Louis VIII, King of France, eldest son of Philip Augustus and of Isabella of Hainaut, was born in Paris on the 5th of September 1187. Louis was short, thin, pale-faced, with studious tastes, cold and placid temper, sober and chaste in his life. He left the reputation of a saint, but was also a warrior prince.
				</p>
				<p>
				===1200 Marriage to Blanche of Castile===<br />
				At the age of 12, Louis was married to Blanche of Castile on 23 May 1200, following prolonged negotiations between Philip Augustus and Blanche's uncle John of England. &lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;  (as represented in William Shakespeare's historical play King John).<br />
				On May 23, 1200, Louis married Blanche of Castile , daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile, who effectively acted as regent after Louis's death. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Blance was born March 4, 1188 and died November 26, 1252.<br />
				In 1212 Louis seized Saint-Omer and Aire to prevent a powerful Flanders from being on the flank of his county of Artois. <br />
				In 1213 he led the campaign against Ferrand, count of Flanders; in 1214, while Philip Augustus was winning the victory of Bouvines, he held John of England in check, and was victorious at La Roche-aux-Moines.
				</p>
				<p>
				===1216 First Barons War===<br />
				In 1216 the English barons rebelled in the First Barons' War against the unpopular King John of England (1199-1216) and offered the throne to Prince Louis. Louis invaded and was proclaimed King in London in May 1216, although he was not crowned. There was little resistance when the prince entered London. At St Paul's Cathedral, Louis was accepted as ruler with great pomp and celebration in the presence of all of London. Many nobles, including Alexander II of Scotland (1214-49), gathered to give homage to him.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;<br />
				On June 14 he captured Winchester and soon conquered over half of the English kingdom. After a year and a half of war, most of the rebellious barons had defected and so Louis had to give up his claim to be the King of England by signing the Treaty of Lambeth in 1217. The effect of the treaty was that Louis agreed he had never been the legitimate king of England.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;<br />
				After a year and a half of war, King John's death, and his replacement by a regency on behalf of the boy king Henry III (John's son), many of the rebellious barons deserted Louis. When his army was beaten at Lincoln, and his naval forces (led by Eustace the Monk) were defeated off the coast of Sandwich, he was forced to make peace under English terms.<br />
				The principal provisions of the Treaty of Lambeth were an amnesty for English rebels, land possession to return to the status quo ante, the Channel Islands to be returned to the English crown, Louis to undertake not to attack England again, and to attempt to give Normandy back to the English crown, and 10,000 marks to be given to Louis. The effect of the treaty was that Louis agreed he had never been the legitimate king of England.<br />
				In 1216, after the barons rebelling against King John of England had offered the English throne to Louis in return for his aid, Louis went to England to aid the rebels. Initially he was successful, but eventually he was defeated at sea and suffered defections. <br />
				In 1217, when peace was concluded at Kingston, Louis was secretly paid 10,000 marks. <br />
				In the autumn of 1215 Louis received from a group of English barons, headed by Geoffrey de Mandeville, a request to "pluck them out of the hand of this tyrant" (John). Some 7000 French knights were sent over to England during the winter and two more contingents followed, but it was only after twenty-four English hostages had arrived in Paris that Louis himself prepared to invade England. The expedition was forbidden by the papal legate, but Louis set out from Calais on the 20th and landed at Stonor on the 22nd of May 1216. In three months he had obtained a strong foothold in eastern England, and in the end of July he laid siege to Dover, while part of his army besieged Windsor with a view to securing the safety of London.<br />
				The pretexts on which he claimed the English crown were set down in a memorandum drawn up by French lawyers in 1215. These claims -- that John had forfeited the crown by the murder of his nephew, Arthur of Brittany, and that the English barons had the right to dispose of the vacant throne -- lost their plausibility on the death of King John and the accession of his infant son as King Henry III in October 1216.<br />
				The papal legate, Gualo, who had forbidden the enterprise, had arrived in England at the same time as Louis. He excommunicated the French troops and the English rebels, and Henry III found a valiant defender in William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke. After the "Fair of Lincoln", in which his army was defeated, Louis was compelled to resign his pretensions, though by a secret article of the treaty of Lambeth (September 1217) he secured a small war indemnity.<br />
				Louis had assisted Simon de Montfort in his war against the Albigenses in 1215, and after his return to France he again joined the crusade. With Simon's son and successor, Amauri de Montfort, he directed the brutal massacre which followed the capture of Marmande.<br />
				Philippe II, suspicious of his son until the close of his life, took precautions to assure his obedience, narrowly watched his administration in Artois, which Louis held from his mother Isabella, and, contrary to the custom of the kings of France, did not associate his son with him by having him crowned. When Philip Augustus was dying on the 14th of July 1223, Louis VIII was anointed at Reims on the 6th of August 1224.  Louis surrounded himself with councillors whom his father had chosen and formed, and continued his father's policy.
				</p>
				<p>
				===1223 King of France=== <br />
				Louis VIII succeeded his father on July 14, 1223; his coronation took place on August 6 of the same year in the cathedral at Reims. As King, he continued to seek revenge on the Angevins and seized Poitou and Saintonge from them in 1224. There followed the seizure of Avignon and Languedoc.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;<br />
				Louis The Lion, or The Lion-heart was known (in French) as Louis Le Lion, or Louis Coeur-de-lion. He was the Capetian king of France from 1223 who spent most of his short reign establishing royal power in Poitou and Languedoc. <br />
				In 1224, now king, he seized Poitou and, in 1226, he launched a successful crusade against the Albigensian heretics, capturing the major fortress of Avignon, He took a personal role in this, and was responsible for the massacre of a vast number of people, including women and children. He then returned to Paris because of dysentery. His doctor's medical opinion was that he would be cured "by using a woman". A suitable virgin was found, unknown to Louis, and was sent to his room. Louis said, "I will not commit mortal sin for whatever reason" and gave instructions that the girl should be honorably married. He then died at age thirty-nine. <br />
				Louis was the first Capetian to grant appanages on a large scale and to have a reversion clause that made alienation of royal property more difficult. Louis also developed other particular rights for the kingship, such as the concept that fealty was sworn not only to the individual king but also to the kingship. His eldest son, Louis IX (afterward St. Louis), peacefully succeeded him while his other sons received appanages. <br />
				 Louis VIII the Lion (French: Louis VIII le Lion) (September 5, 1187 - November 8, 1226) reigned as King of France from 1223 to 1226. He was a member of the House of Capet. Louis VIII was born in Paris, France, the son of Philip II of France and Isabelle of Hainaut.&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved June 26, 2003, from Encyclopædia Britannica Premium Service.&lt;/ref&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1223  Persecution of Jews===<br />
				On 1 November 1223, he issued an ordinance that prohibited his officials from recording debts owed to Jews, thus reversing the policies set by his father Philip II of France (1180-1223). Usury (lending money with interest) was illegal for Christians to practice, according to Church law it was seen as a vice in which people profited from others' misfortune (like gambling), and was punishable by excommunication, a severe punishment. However since Jews were not Christian, they could not be excommunicated, and thus fell in to a legal gray area which secular rulers would sometimes exploit by allowing (or requesting) Jews to provide usury services, often for personal gain to the secular ruler, and to the discontent of the Church. Louis VIII's prohibition was one attempt at resolving this legal problem which was a constant source of friction in Church and State courts.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;<br />
				Twenty six barons accepted, but Theobald IV (1201-53), the powerful Count of Champagne, did not, since he had an agreement with the Jews that guaranteed him extra income through taxation. Theobald IV would become a major opposition force to Capetian dominance, and his hostility was manifest during the reign of Louis VIII. For example, during the siege of Avignon, he performed only the minimum service of 40 days, and left home amid charges of treachery.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;<br />

				===1225 Campaign Against Southern Barons===<br />
				In 1225, the council of Bourges excommunicated the count of Toulouse, Raymond VII, and declared a crusade against the southern barons. Louis happily renewed the conflict in order to enforce his royal rights. Roger Bernard the Great, count of Foix, tried to keep the peace, but the king rejected his embassy and the counts of Foix and Toulouse took up arms against him. The king was largely successful, but he did not complete the work before his death.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1226  Death===<br />
				While returning to Paris, King Louis VIII became ill with dysentery, and died on November 8, 1226 in the chateau at Montpensier, Auvergne.<br />
				While returning to Paris, King Louis VIII became ill with dysentery, and died on November 8, 1226 in the chateau at Montpensier, Auvergne. The Saint Denis Basilica houses the tomb of Louis VIII. His son, Louis IX (1226-70), succeeded him on the throne.<br />
				Louis' reign was taken up with two great designs: to destroy the power of the Plantagenets, and to conquer the heretical south of France. An expedition conquered Poitou and Saintonge (1224); in 1226 he led the crusade against the Albigenses in the south, forced Avignon to capitulate and received the submission of Languedoc.<br />
				His reign, short as it was, brought gains both to the royal domains and to the power of the crown over the feudal lords
				</p>
				<p>
