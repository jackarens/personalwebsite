				[[Category:Clan Fleming]]<br />
				------<br />
				== Biography ==The lineage of this person, and where he came from is in doubt.  Balfour Paul suggesting  "There is no evidence that the first four members of the pedigree given by Sir Robert Douglas, (in his Peerage) viz. Baldwin, Waldeve his son, William, and Sir Malcolm, were ancestors of the family of Biggar, and the references given by him to Sir Malcolm last mentioned apply undoubtedly to a later person of that name."&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/518/mode/2up page 519]&lt;/ref&gt;  This notice is intriguing especially when considered in light of the lack of appearance of Robert Fleming amongst those of his name, of Scotland, on the Ragman Rolls of 1291 and 1296.  Even William Hunter, the family historian, is not confident. &lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] William Hunter; [https://archive.org/stream/biggarhouseoffle1867hunt#page/468/mode/2up page 468]&lt;/ref&gt; However to add support to the case of lineage from Baldwin is the case of the lands.  Biggar, in South Lanarkshire, was an estate granted to a Baldwin, known to be a Fleming leader, by David I.  Baldwin is known to have built a motte and bailey castle on the estate, the remains of which can still be seen north-west of the High Street.  Biggar is the estate that is inherited by the younger son of Robert, Patrick.  Balfour Paul, noting this, suggests the lands may have been acquired through marriage.  This is further discussed in "Further Research" below where we can prove the lineage previously supposed to be invalid.<br />
				Balfour Paul first notices Robert&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/520/mode/2up page 520]&lt;/ref&gt; as "one of theleading men of Scotland" in 1290.  He appears on the Parliamentary Record twice that year, but only that year, once in relation to the Treaty of Salisbury, where he clearly appears to have represented Scotland and then during the Parliament deciding to nominate Margaret, the Maid of Norway, to Prince Edward of England.  Both Parliaments were held at Birgham, a small village in the Borders.  The Treaty of Salisbury was endorsed by Scotland at this Parliament (thus Treaty of Birgham) on 14 March 1290.&lt;ref&gt;The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2015), [http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1290/3/1 1290/3/1].&lt;/ref&gt;  The second Parliament, as result of the first and held on 17 March 1290 , nominated, Margaret.&lt;ref&gt;The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2015), [http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1290/3/2 1290/3/2].&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert ''the'' Fleming, appearing without designation or title, attended both.<br />
				He was clearly of age at this point.  Balfour Paul suggests he swore fealty to Edward I.  However it is noticed that there is no Robert Fleming amongst the nobles of Scotland on the Ragman Rolls of either 1291 or 1296, implying that he had sworn fealty prior to 1291 or was not required.<br />
				William Hunter provides that he was with Bruce, in 1305, when Bruce was summoned to appear before the Justiciars of Scotland; Roger de Kirkpatrick and Walter Burgketon.  The court being held at Dumfries.  Bruce, as a freeholder in Annandale, was, no doubt,  summoned to give suit and service for his lands.  He, it is stated, set out to Dumfries, attended by his brother Edward, and Robert Fleming.<br />
				He was certainly with Bruce before 10 Feb 1306 as both Balfour Paul and William Hunter&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] William Hunter; [https://archive.org/details/biggarhouseoffle1867hunt#page/468/mode/2up page 469]&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that he was with Bruce at the murder of John Comyn at Dumfries.  William Hunter providing this is the event where the family obtains their motto.   Robert Fleming returning to the church with Sir Roger Kirkpatrick to ensure that Comyn was dead.  On their return Bruce sought confirmation when, according to family legend, Fleming held up the bloody head and exclaimed, "Let the deed shaw".<br />
				Balfour Paul suggests that as a reward for his services he received from the King a charter of the lands of Lenzie and Cumbernauld in Dumbartonshire which had been forfeited by John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, thus occurring after March 1306.  This is the first event he is noticed as bearing title "of Cumbernauld".<br />
				It seems probable that he died as a result of this and the events that followed and he was certainly dead prior to 1314 and does not appear at the Battle of Bannockburn.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Family===His wife is not noticed in source material.  There are two sons noticed by both Balfour Paul and William Hunter:<br />
				* [[Fleming-1184|Malcolm Fleming]], the older of the two, gains title to Fulwood (Foulwood at times) and Cumbernauld, and will succeed his father.<br />
				* [[Fleming-324|Patrick Fleming]], the younger of the two, gains the title to Biggar.   William Hunter&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] William Hunter; [https://archive.org/details/biggarhouseoffle1867hunt#page/468/mode/2up page 469]&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that he received these lands for his patrimony.

				===Further Research===
				</p>
				<p>
				====Is there a source for this wife??====There is no record, in source material, that he married a [[Douglas-400|Joan Douglas]] of Herdmanston.  Herdmanston was held by the Sinclairs and there would not have been a Joan Douglas there, if she existed at all, of the nobility needed to marry Robert Fleming if he was of note.  Given the relationships between Fleming and Douglas it hardly seems likely.  This Profile has been disconnected pending suitable source material.  It seems more likely he married the Heiress of Biggar, discussed below.
				</p>
				<p>
				====Who was the father of Robert ? ====The first notice of Robert on record is 1290 during the Scottish Parliament considerations at Birgham.  However the People of Medieval Scotland website notices a manuscript which would not have been available to Balfour Paul or William Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;People of Medieval Scotland, [http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/source/5102/ National Library of Scotland, Advocates Library, MS 31.2.4]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this source, the "Robert the Fleming", of the Treaty of Birgham is said to be the same as designed as "lord of Wardhouse" (Aberdeenshire).  The Charter provides that he had a brother, Michael, to whom he provided a grant of the land of the ferry boat at Montrose and a certain piece of land whereon the manor of the lord of Hedderwick is located (the Hedderwick estate was a large estate near Montrose).  This family is presumably the one that has John, noticed below in regards to the Ragman Rolls.  This though would imply that he had died before 1296 which he did not; thus it likely they were not the same; they certainly are designated differently with one Sir Robert Fleming, Lord of Wardhouse, and the other Robert the Fleming.
				</p>
				<p>
				====Lands of Biggar====A consideration of relevant charters to the lands of Biggar is not supportive of the assertions made, by Douglas in The Peerage, in regards to supposed lineage.  <br />
				The earliest record found relates to a Baldwin of Biggar, noted in Balfour Paul.  He was the Sheriff of Lanark and flourished between 1160 and 1173&lt;ref&gt;People of Medieval Scotland, Individual no. 173 (http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/person/173/;)&lt;/ref&gt;and certainly had a son, Waltheof (Waldeve in Balfour Paul)&lt;ref&gt;People of Medieval Scotland, Individual no. 311 (http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/person/311/;)&lt;/ref&gt;.  Waltheof appears to have flourished between 1160 and 1180 but is not noticed as being titled, suggesting he died within the life time of his father.   He had a son, Robert, who is noted as "of Biggar".&lt;ref&gt;People of Medieval Scotland, Individual no. 4006 (http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/person/4006/;)&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				As the point of diversion from supposed lineage there is noticed, in the Record of Kelso Abbey&lt;ref&gt;Kelso Liber, i, no. 186&lt;/ref&gt; and also noticed on People of Medieval Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;People of Medieval Scotland, Source No. H3/89/2 (http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/source/4032/;)&lt;/ref&gt; a record of Hugh of Biggar, son of Robert, son of Waltheof of Biggar, patron of the church of Strathaven.  This source is positively dated to 14 Feb 1229.  One of the witnesses to that source is a William Fleming, suggesting that the use of Fleming as a surname was contemporary.  Thus, to this point, c. 1230, the lineage of the ownership of Biggar is intact and that it was Robert that followed Waldeve, not William, and Hugh that followed Robert, not Sir Malcolm.  Clearly Douglas, in his Peerage, is incorrect.<br />
				After Hugh of Biggar the record gets sketchy with no clear and direct lineage.  The lands are noted:<br />
				* 1230;  There was a Simon of Biggar&lt;ref&gt;People of Medieval Scotland, Individual no. 2373 (http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/person/2373/;)&lt;/ref&gt; (or 'Bygres') occurs as precentor (the person that leads the singing in church) of Glasgow on 2 January 1259 and 19 April 1266.   He came from lands of Biggar in Lanarkshire, and might be the same as Simon medicus 'de Bygre' or his son.  By 1232, he was styled Master (Maestor) and was a canon of Glasgow by 1237-8.  He might also have held Carnwath prebend,&lt;ref&gt;A stipend usually drawn from specific sources in the income of the cathedral's estates&lt;/ref&gt; which would make him the same as Simon 'de Carniwyth'.  In January 1259, he was promoted to precentor of Glasgow, which he perhaps held until his death after 19 April 1266 (probably×Dec. 1269).  He had a brother Thomas and must have been a son or brother to Hugh above.<br />
				* 1262; there is notice&lt;ref&gt;Paisley Registrum, 376-7&lt;/ref&gt; of a William of Biggar.&lt;ref&gt;People of Medieval Scotland, Source No. H3/460/1 (http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/source/5049/;)&lt;/ref&gt;  While this is only one Charter, dated 22 May 1262, it indicates he held the title.<br />
				* 1262; there is notice of a Malcolm of Biggar on a jury of Inquisition of Lands.&lt;ref&gt;People of Medieval Scotland, Individual no. 9851 (http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/person/9851/;)&lt;/ref&gt;  There is one Charter only but the appearance as juror suggests he held the lands.  The Charter is dated to the Monday before the feast of Blessed Gregory.  His feast day is 3 September but it is confusing.  The original feast day was 12 March but it was moved, as 12 March always falls in Lent, to 3 September.  The date of the feast day in 1262 is not clear.  Thus either Malcolm or William held the title first.  Regardless, before 1273, it was next held by Sir Nicholas of Biggar.<br />
				* 1290; and the same Parliament as discussed regarding Robert, noted above, there is a Sir Nicholas of Biggar.&lt;ref&gt;People of Medieval Scotland, Individual no. 11359 (http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/person/11359/)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same source&lt;ref&gt;People of Medieval Scotland, Source No.  H1/50/32 (http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/source/6984/)&lt;/ref&gt; Robert is stated as Robert the Fleming.  Sir Nicholas of Biggar appears relatively frequently between 1273 and 1290.  There was certainly a strong relationship between Nicholas and Robert Bruce, father to Robert I, as is noted in an agreement signed at Lochmaben in 1290.&lt;ref&gt;People of Medieval Scotland, Source No. 77572 (http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/factoid/77572/)&lt;/ref&gt;  He may not have been alive in 1303, although a Charter exists, as the Charter notices that Baird is held to him and his heirs, implying he was not but had been when the relationship was struck.  He certainly held the lands and titles to Biggar as is noticed in an Inquisition of Lands of Baird, held to him by John of Baird, then deceased and his son, Alexander but stolen by Sir John Seagrave.  The lands were in Elemston in the Barony of Strathaven (Lanarkshire).  Recall that Hugh of Biggar (mentioned above in 1229) was the benefactor of the church at Strathaven.<br />
				* 1296, Ragman Rolls, on 28 August 1296 at Berwick, there is a Hugh of Biggar and a Richard Lawson of Biggar that swears fealty.  This suggests that either Richard Lawson was a knight held to Hugh of Biggar or that Hugh was a Lawson.
				</p>
				<p>
				====Family Events====It is generally accepted that Malcolm was the older boy which presents an anomaly if Robert held the title to Biggar, suggesting that he did hold the estates in his own right.  They must have been held in right of his wife implying he had married the heiress.   Then Patrick, as the second son, would have been granted the maternal estates.<br />
				If we are to suppose that Malcolm was only just of age by Bannockburn, as suggested in source material, in 1314 he was therefore born about 1290, Patrick, who is not mentioned as being at the battle, must have been born after.
				</p>
				<p>
				====Ragman Rolls====<br />
				This Robert is contemporary with the period of the Ragman Rolls.<br />
				The [https://archive.org/stream/instrumentapublica00thomuoft#page/n7/mode/2up Instrumenta Publica Sive Processus Super Fidelitatibus Et Homagiis Scotorum Domino Regi Angliae Factis] or Ragman Rolls are a collection of two Rolls, one in 1291/92 and the other in 1296, collected of the nobles of Scotland, or nobles that held lands there, swearing fealty to Edward I.  <br />
				There is no Robert Fleming on either Roll.  Given the lineage provided and supposed, this is difficult to understand. For reasons that are beyond the scope of this study, Edward was especially diligent, when it came to those of Flemish origins, to ensure they appeared in the 1296 Roll.  Robert Fleming was certainly of age but his name not collected.  This is an anomaly.  Although Fleming was a common name and not all will be of the same family, there are a number of Flemings appearing:
				</p>
				<p>
				* Aleyn (Alan) le Fleming, listed as of Ayrshire.
				</p>
				<p>
				* John Fleming, listed as being of Peebleshire.<br />
				* Sir John Fleming, Lord, who may or may not be the same as above, appears at Aberdeen and in a individual article of fealty given the next day at the same place.  This person is clearly the head of the main Fleming family of the day.<br />
				* Michael le Fleming, stated as being in Kincardineshire, was likely a junior relative of the John above.<br />
				* Patrick Fleming, stated as being of Dunbartonshire, who is likely to be associated with this line of Fleming.<br />
				* Walter le Fleming, stated to be of Lanarkshire, and likely this line of Fleming.<br />
				* William le Fleming, stated as being of Dunbartonshire, who is likely to be associated with this line of Fleming and relative to Patrick above, likely son.<br />
				* Sir William le Fleming, stated to be of Lanarkshire, and likely this line of Fleming, likely father to Walter.<br />
				Other than Patrick, none of these names are used by the line of Robert Fleming.  It implies that, in 1296 and at the time of the Rolls, Robert held no land or titles and was a Household knight.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Joining the Dots===Based on the research above it is clear that Douglas' Peerage is incorrect.  The lands of Biggar can be identified with the lineage: Baldwin, Waltheof, Robert, Hugh; all noted as of Biggar.  Hugh was certainly alive in 1230 and appears to have had three or four sons; Simon, who joined the church, Thomas, of whom nothing is known, William, that appears once and Malcolm that appears in an Inquisition of Lands as Juror.  The next on record is Nicholas, who may have been a son of Hugh as he names his son after him.  Nicholas is noted as Sir and Lord of Biggar and is on record as such from 1273 until 1290 (certainly) and was contemporary with Robert Fleming even appearing on the same Charters.   Nicholas likely died between 1290 and 1296 as Hugh of Biggar sealed the Ragman Rolls.  This is also discussed, although with bias, by William Hunter&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] William Hunter; [https://archive.org/stream/biggarhouseoffle1867hunt#page/466/mode/2up page 467]&lt;/ref&gt; where he adds that Nicholas died previous to 1292, when the marriage of his wife Mary, and the ward and marriage of his daughters Marjory and Ada, were granted by Edward I. of England to Robert, Bishop of Glasgow.  While families of Flemings did exist in Scotland contemporary to the period there is no connection, prior to c. 1300 with the occupants of Biggar.<br />
				'''So how did Robert Fleming gain the lands of Biggar?'''  The only real answer to this lies with a marriage.  He must have married either a daughter of Nicholas or Hugh.  Nicholas is the most likely as Robert's sons were born around 1290 or earlier.  We can thus speculate that Hugh, inherited Biggar, died without heir and the estates passed to Robert in right of his wife.  As noted above, the estates of Biggar were in ward in 1292 but were held by Hugh in 1296.  He appears to have had two sisters, Marjory and Ada, with marriage rights held to Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow.  Wishart was a noted Nationalist and supporter of Bruce; this would not have been a difficult marriage to arrange and likely occurred immediately, c. 1292.<br />
				Robert gains his paternal lands in 1306 from Robert I and thus we can presume that Hugh of Biggar died shortly after but before 1314.  Thus the second son gains the maternal lands, which was the common practise.<br />
				'''So why did Robert Fleming not sign the Ragman Rolls?'''  At the time he held no lands.  He was likely a Household knight of Bruce of Annandale.  It is also this relationship that put him in contact with Nicholas of Biggar through his relationship with Bruce.  <br />
				'''So where did he come from?'''  If the association of Annandale is correct it seems plausible that he was a relative of the Alan de Fleming, of Ayrshire, that signed the Ragman Roll.  However the most likely answer, given he was called Robert ''the'' Fleming, was that he was born in Flanders and not in Scotland at all.

In order to accomplish this, I would like to disconnect both sets of Malcolms the fathers (who by the way have entirely different ancestors) &lt;a href="/wiki/Fleming-326" title="Fleming-326"&gt;Fleming-326&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="/wiki/Fleming-494" title="Fleming-494"&gt;Fleming-494&lt;/a&gt; Ok? Any objections?</span><br />
