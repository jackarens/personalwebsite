				== Biography ==<br />
				Robert de Boyt (Boyd) 1st Feudal Baron of Kilmarnock b.   d. 1333 at Halidon HillRobert de Boyt (Boyd) the son of Robert Dictus Boyt (Boyd).  He is mentioned in the Ragman Roll of 1296, rendering homage to Edward the first as Sir Robert de Boyt. Note:  The Ragman Rolls refers to the collection of written instruments by which the nobility and gentry of Scotland subscribed allegiance to King Edward I of England, during the time between the Conference of Norham in May 1291 and the final award in favour of Balliol in November 1292; and again in 1296.Around 1290, during the occupation of Scotland by the armies of Edward I, the English committed an atrocity in Ayr by hanging a number of Scottish nobles. It is believed that Sir Robert Boyd, the hero of Goldberry Hill was amongst the murdered men along with members of the Wallace family.  As a result of this atrocity Sir Robert de Boyt (Boyd) joined forces with William Wallace and other Scottish patriots to fight for Scottish independence. Sir Robert de Boyt ( Boyd) took part in a revenge attack on the English known as “The Burning of the Barns of Ayr”, where the English forces were either burned alive in the grain barns they were using as barracks, or slaughtered as they tried to escape. He also played a part in an engagement with the English troops at Loudoun Hill near Darvel and is believed to have been present at the Battle of Falkirk where Wallace was defeated. In the epic poem “The Wallace”, by Blind Harry, Sir Robert Boyd is mentioned 22 times and is described as being “wys and wicht” (wise and strong). His importance to Wallace’s army was such that “he governyt them quhen Wallace was absent.”  Robert Bruce was crowned King of Scotland at Scone on March 27, 1306, and a short time after his little army was broken and routed and he himself was a fugitive on the Isle of Rathlin. Sir Robert Boyd joined him on Rathlin in February, 1307, and shortly after, with Sir James Douglas, descended with a body of soldiers on the Isle of Arran and captured the castle of Brodick, and Bruce soon joined them.  The Boyds took part in the Battle of Loudon Hill, May 10, 1307.   They were in the third (left) division of the Scottish first line at the Battle of Bannockburn, June 24, 1314, under Walter, 6th Steward, which battle marked the end of English dominion in Scotland. Sir Robert was a member of the Scottish expedition to Ireland in 1315. [1].   He was the faithful companion of Robert the Bruce in the War of Independence and a Robert Boyd attended the King's escheators from Dumbarton to Renfrew with Sir John Walleys and their men at arms, October 1304. (In Law an escheator is an officer whose duty it is to observe what escheats have taken place, and to take charge of them.  An escheat is a common law doctrine that operates to ensure that property is not left in limbo and ownerless).   Robert de Boyt was taken prisoner by the English in the Castle of Kildrummie (In Aberdeenshire, Scotland), shortly before 13 September 1306, a Duncan Boyd having been captured and hanged 4 August previously.  Robert Boyd joined in a letter to the King of France, 16 November 1308, Boyd distinguished himself at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, where he was placed on the crucial right wing of the Scots army so that he could help Edward Bruce, the King’s brother, direct his troops.   In the epic poem “The Wallace”, by Blind Harry  it goes “Ranged on the right the Southron legions stood, and on their front fiery Edward rode, with him the experienced Boyd divides the sway, sent by the King to guide him thro’ the day. The division withstood the main charge of the English cavalry and helped carry the day. Boyd was rewarded by Bruce, in 1316, with lands including West Kilbride, Portincross (where he strengthened the castle) and the Lordship of Kilmarnock where he began building Dean Castle. Sir Robert was also one of the guarantors of a peace treaty with England in 1323, but after the death of Robert the Bruce in 1329, Boyd was called on again as the English renewed hostilities. In 1333 he had a grant from King Robert to 'Roberto Boyd, militi, dilecto et fideli nostro,' of the lands of Kilmarnock, Bondington, and Hertschaw, which were John de Baliol's; the lands of ilbryd and Ardnel (Portincross), which were Godfrey de Ross's son to the deceased Reginald de Ross; all the land which was William de Mora's, in the tenement of Dalry; with seven acres of land, which were Robert de Ross's in the tenement of Ardnel;  all erected into an entire and free barony to be held of the King. He had also a charter of the lands of Nodelles dale; and a third, granting Hertschaw in free forest. He was one of the guarantors of a treaty of peace with the English 1323. Against Boyd’s, and other experienced Scottish commanders advice, the Scots attacked an invading English army at Halidon Hill in 1333. The Scots were roundly defeated and Sir Robert Boyd was taken prisoner at the battle of Halidon hill, 19 July 1333, and died not long afterwards. [2]. The English however, due to the efforts of Boyd and others like him, were never able to gain a strong foothold in Scotland again. He had three sons:<br />
				Sir Thomas: He succeeded to the Boyd estates.Sir Alan: He commanded the Scottish archers at the siege of Perth, held by Edward Baliol, and was killed there in August, 1333.<br />
				James de Boyd: He witnessed a charter in 1342.
