				== Biography ==William's parents are said to have been Robert de Saint-clair in Normandy, and Eleanor, daughter of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_II_of_Dreux Robert], second Comte de Dreux and Yolande de Coucy, his second wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-19]] Vol 6, Page 564&lt;/ref&gt;  Wikipedia mentions that Robert de Dreux and Yolande produced around 12 children, most of which seem to be lost to history.  The Foundation for Medieval Genealogy also notes the same.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-22]] at http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/PARIS%20REGION%20NOBILITY.htm#RobertIIDreuxdied1218B&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				It is worth noting that the dates fit.  Assuming that [[Dreux-8|Eleanor]] was a daughter of Robert de Dreux she must have been born after 1195 but before 1218 and the 1198 provided on Wikitree seems to fit.<br />
				While noting this a possibility it is also worth noting that a family of St Clair were recorded in Scotland well prior to 1180.  There is a record:  "Richard de Moreville, the Constable, sold to Henry de St. Clair, Edmund the son of Bonda, and Gillemichael, his brother, and their sons and daughters, and all their progeny, for the sum of three merks".&lt;ref&gt;Act. Parl. Scot., i, p. 94 and recorded in Lewis; Early Scottish Charters; pg 317&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_de_Morville Richard de Morville] was Constable of Scotland from 1162 until his death in 1189.  Given that this William named his eldest son Henry it seems a possibility that his father was Henry.<br />
				It is not clear where he was born.  It certainly was not Rosslyn as these lands had not yet been granted to the family.  Wherever he was born he was in Scotland and in a position of some influence before 1264.<br />
				''It is clear that the origins of William are a work in progress so if there are any facts that can develop this please expose them.  Everything on WikiTree is a collaborative work-in-progress.''
				</p>
				<p>
				== In Scotland ==<br />
				He was Sheriff of Edinburgh in 1266 and 1288-90, Haddington 1264-1290, Linlithgow 1264-1290, Dumfries 1288, and Justiciar of Galwythie 1288-1289. &lt;ref&gt;[[#S-19]] Vol 6, Page 564&lt;/ref&gt; <br />
				He was a great favourite of Alexander III and this relationship is mentioned in many sources including Balfour Paul.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-19]] Vol6,  Page 564&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander appointed him Guardian to his son between 1279 and 1281 and it was in this duty that the family were provided with the lands of Rosslyn.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-19]] Vol 6, Page 564; Alexander granted the lands on 14 September 1280 on the resignation of those lands by Henry de Roskelyn.  This transaction is also noted in the Chartulary of Newbattle Abbey, to which they became intimately associated with over the years, on page 290&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				He was a member of the Scottish parliament that met to determine who would be successor to King Alexander III.   William was also part of the delegation, sent by Alexander III, to France in 1285 to escort the Queen elect, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolande_of_Dreux,_Queen_of_Scotland Yolande of Dreux], daughter of Robert, fourth Comte de Dreux, to Scotland.  It should be noted that Yolande must therefore have been related to William.  Her father, Robert, is, according to what has been stated, the grandnephew to William's mother.  <br />
				On 12 July 1291 he and William de Boyville are appointed, by Edward I., to take the homage pleas to the new King of Scotland and to Edward I as overlord, of initially the Bishop of Whitherne, and thereafter with the Bishop, those of all Galloway.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-20]] Bain's ii, no. 508.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				He appears on the Homage Rolls for 1292 as  "Sancto Claro, Dominus Willielmus de (miles), (William. de Seint Clere)", along with his son  "Sancto Claro, Dominus Henricus de (miles)".  His seal is provided by McAndrew.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S21]] McAndrew; page 703, No 3031.  Seal provided as a cross engrailed and depicted on this page&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also one of the nobles of Scotland that signed and sealed the General Release of Obligations on Edward I., thereby releasing him from all the obligations that he had made during the consideration of Scotland's King.  His seal is still intact and recorded in Bain's Calendar&lt;ref&gt;[[#S20]] Bain's ii, no. 658 where the seal is recorded "On a round seal within rounded tracery (upper part broken) a shield charged with a cross engrailed (or lozengy) apparently resting on a luce's(?) head emerging at the dexter side, a smaller one at the other.  . . . . elmi de s'co claro mil . . ."&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				Although initially loyal to Edward I, and for which he was provided an annual grant, he sided with Balliol in the Scottish Parliament of 1294 and the Scottish action against Edward I.  This "mutiny" led to the invasion of Scotland by Edward I., in 1296, the subsequent [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Berwick_%281296%29 Sack of Berwick] and then the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dunbar_%281296%29 Battle of Dundar], all disastrous for Scotland.  William is stated to be one of those captured at Dunbar Castle and sent to the Tower of London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-19]] Vol6, Page 564-565; although it should be noted that a check of Bain's Calendar of Documents, used as a source by Balfour Paul does not mention this William although mentions his son as being assigned to Gloucester Castle.&lt;/ref&gt;  The record&lt;ref&gt;[[#S20]] Bain's ii, no. 742&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a number of the St. Clairs; Alexander de St Clair was assigned to Windsor castle; Reginald de St Clair to Kenilworth Castle; ''Master'' William de St Clair to Gloucester Castle; and Sir Henry de St Clair to St Briavell's castle (which is in Gloucestershire)
				</p>
				<p>
				== Death and Legacy ==Although Balfour Paul mentions that he was at Dunbar and then sent to the Tower the evidence of Bain's does not support the imprisonment and he is not recorded along with the other at the Tower of London or, indeed, being a prisoner.  It seems highly probable that he died at or soon after the Battle of Dunbar.  Gray in the Scalacronica&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Gray; Page 16&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that "William de St Clere" was one of seven barons taken at Dunbar castle although it is not known whether his father was at Dunbar and Gray is notorious for getting names incorrect and would simply being using the armorial as evidence - which of course suggests the undifferenced arms and thus the head of the family was in the castle.   <br />
				Balfour Paul also raises the concern regarding his wife.  He mentions&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-19]] Vol 6, Page 565&lt;/ref&gt; that he was said to have married Agnes, the daughter of Patrick of Dunbar, but this supposition lacks evidence and states that he married an Amicia.  He records&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-19]] Vol 6, Page 565&lt;/ref&gt; that she was provided a letter of protection by Edward I., dated 7 April 1299.  This letter is recorded in Bain's Calendar of Documents&lt;ref&gt;[[#S20]] Bain's  ii, no. 1104&lt;/ref&gt; where it is stated "Amicia, widow of William de St Clair, dwelling by the K.'s leave in the county of Edinburgh in Scotland, has a protection for two years."  It is worth noting that Rosslyn is within the boundaries of Edinburghshire as it was then.

The research suggests he was not born to Robert and Eleanore as mentioned here.  While this couple did marry they married late in life, she was 60, and in 1248.  William was already an adult about 1260/65 when he was granted the Templelands of Gorton.  While I have been unable to determine his parents it seems that he was a junior son of the Sinclairs of Herdmanston and employed at Edinburgh castle for the Lord of Gorton, then Constable.  They lands were given by Walter Melville, himself on staff at the castle.  Public comment has expired.  Please read the paper for discussion.</span><br />

Magnus' lands were inhabited by those of Norwegian descent. Magnus was involved in the 1863 Invasion of Scotland by the Norwegian King Haakan. Caught between a rock and a hard place, he fought first for Haakan and later switched back to Alexander III of Scotland. William Sinclair was an Ambassador of the Scottish court, and is said to have married Magnus' daughter Matilda. It might explain what is a mystery to historians - how Magnus survived changing his loyalty back to Alexander. &lt;p&gt;I'm not well versed in Scottish history, this is just what I have discovered working on Magnus' profile. I do agree the two Matilda profiles should be merged. Matilda Unknown has a brother Magnus IV. Matilda Orkney's father was Magnus III, and she had two brothers, John and Magnus.</span><br />

This one is generally recorded as the first of the line of the Sinclairs of Roslyn.  His bio is as given here for the most part.  It seems more than likely that he died in the Tower as a result of his conflict with Edward I, the siege of Dunbar mentioned or at Dunbar itself.  Certainly The Scots Peerage agrees with this.  That source makes mention of the Letter of Protection which can be found in Bain's Calendar relating to the period.  She, Amicia, is recorded as the widow of William de St Clair - this one.  This suggests he was dead by then (7 Apr 1299).  He did not sign the Homage Roll in 1296, which was after Dunbar and I have found no record of his release from the Tower.  It was his grandson that died in Spain.  I have corrected the bio accordingly.&lt;p&gt;I also think that the marriages here should be broken other than the Amicia one which is supported.  The two Matildas appear to be the same anyway and I don't believe that this William Sinclair had anything to do with the Orkneys.</span><br />
