				[[ferch Llywarch-3|Tangwystl]], daughter of llywarch "Goch" of Rhos and his wife &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt; was the first of several mistresses of Llywelyn ap Iorwerth.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Name===<br />
				Tangwystl ferch Llywarch Goch[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tw1aAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=llewllyn%20the%20great%20ap%20Iorweth&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]<br />
				*Tangwystl ferch Llywarch Goch[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tw1aAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=llewllyn%20the%20great%20ap%20Iorweth&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]*Tangwystl "Goch" verch Llywarch, II&lt;ref name="geni"&gt; Tangwystl verch Llywarch, Geni.  Managed by Bernard Raimond Assaf, Last Updated July 31, 2015.  http://www.geni.com/people/Tangwystl-verch-Llywarch/6000000007455717347.  Accessed Feb 17, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				The name"Tangwystl" Means "Pledge Of Peace".  &lt;ref&gt; Sharon Kay Penman "Falls the Shadow", p. 136.  Cited by Kinship Tree. &lt;/ref&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				Name 	Tangwystl Goch  &lt;ref name="kinship"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===Birth===<br />
				: Birth:  1168  Denbighshire, Wales{{citation needed}} &lt;ref&gt; A birth year of 1168 would make her 5 years older than Llywelyn, whose generally accepted birth year is 1173.  If their son Gruffydd was born in 1198, the year often reported, Tangwystl would have been 30 and Llywelyn would have been 25 at the time.  This combination of dates strongly invites further research! &lt;/ref&gt; <br />
				Born in Rhos, modern location Denbighshire, abt 1168 &lt;ref name="kinship"&gt; Kinship Tree.  Anonymous Web Sitehttp://kinshiptree.com/getperson.php?personID=I74453&amp;tree=kinshiptree &lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				Tangwystl was born about 1178 in Rhos, Gwynedd &lt;ref&gt; Rhos was in the Kingdom or Principality of Gwynedd in 1178 and is in Denbighshire in today's  Wales. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entered by [[Chadsey-9 | Megan Chadsey]], Thursday, April 30, 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				Llywarch Goch had a daughter who was a mistress of Llewelyn Fawr.  That lady, born c. 1180, was a daughter of Llywarch Goch ap Iorwerth ap Cynan ap Llywarch Goch ap Llywarch Hwlbwrch.  &lt;ref&gt; Darrell Wolcott,  Ancient Wales Studies,  #11 - LLYWARCH HWLBWRCH.   http://www.ancientwalesstudies.org/id179.html.  Accessed February 19, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===Date Estimation===<br />
				*Tangwystl was probably born after 1173, the birth year of Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, father of her child.  &lt;ref name="fmg"&gt;[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/WALES.htm#Llywellyndied1240B Llywelyn ap Iorwerth], Cawley, Llywelyn ap Iorwerth.  The Foundation for Medieval Genealogy].  Accessed February 16, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;  *If Gruffydd's conception took place in 1204, and Tangwystl was 18 at the time, her birth year would have been 1186.  If Tangwystl was 15 at the time, a not uncommon occurrance, here birth year might have been 1189. *Gruffydd, son of Tangwystl and Llywelyn, was probably born before the 1205 wedding of Llywelyn and Joan. &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt;   Cawley believes there may have been a wife prior to Joan.

				</p>
				<p>
				===Llywelyn's first marriage===<br />
				Some time in the 1190's Tangwystl became the mistress of Llywelyn ap Iorwerth who was born 1173 &lt;ref name="ra5298"&gt; Douglas Richardson, Royal Ancestry, Volume 5, p. 298 &lt;/ref&gt;.  At the time she became his mistress, it is likely that he was married to his first wife, the daughter of Hugh, Earl of Chester, which wife died prior to 11 Nov 1199 without issue.  &lt;ref name="ra5298"/&gt;<br />
				LLYWELYN ap Iorwerth, was the son of IORWERTH "Drwyndwyn/flat nose" Prince of Gwynedd &amp; his wife Marared of Powys (1173-11 Apr 1240[265], bur Aberconway).  &lt;ref name=FMG /&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===Llywelyn's possible second marriage===<br />
				In 1199 Llywelyn proposed to marry the widow of his uncle, Rhodri ap Owain, who died in 1195, and who was the daughter of Reynold (or Rognvaldr), King of Man.  Pope Innocent III granted permission for him to marrh her 19 April 1203, which permission was rescinded 17 Feb 1204/5.  It is unknown if the marriage ever took place.  &lt;ref name="ra5298"/&gt;  
				</p>
				<p>
				===1195 Llywelyn's union with Tangwystl===<br />
				Mistress (1): TANGWYSTL, daughter of LLYWARCH "Goch" of Rhos &amp; his wife ---. &lt;ref name=FMG /&gt;<br />
				She united with Prince Of Wales Llywelyn Fawr Ap Iorwerth Prince Of Wales,   He was born  1173.  Of today's Caernarvonshire, Wales &lt;ref name="kinship"/&gt;<br />
				Llywelyn died 11 Apr 1240, in today's Aberconwy, Arllechwedd Uchaf, Caernarvonshire, Wales  &lt;ref name="kinship"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				She was a concubine.&lt;ref name="kinship"/&gt;<br />
				William Warrington in 1823 wrote that "Prince Llewelyn, in his youth, had married Tangwystl, daughter of Llywarch Goch the lord of Rhos."  Other sources indicate Tangwystl was his mistress concurrently with his marriage to Joan.&lt;ref name="warrington"&gt;William Warrington, W., (1823).

				===1205 Llywelyn's marriage to Joan===<br />
				Before 23 March 204/5, Llywelyn married Joan Fitzjohn, Illegitimate daughter of King John of England.  &lt;ref name="ra5298"/&gt;  This marriage was offered by King John as a means of cementing his rule over Wales.  <br />
				Under the terms of the marriage arrangement, Llywelyn would reject any illegitimate children from inheritance rights to his rule, in favor of his eldest legitimate son, who would be Dafydd, born about 1212.  <br />
				 m secondly (after 16 Apr 1205) JOAN [of England], illegitimate daughter of JOHN King of England &amp; his mistress Clementia Pinel (-30 Mar 1237).  &lt;ref name=FMG /&gt;<br />
				King John confirmed "castrum de Ellesmara" to "Lewelino principi Norwallie in maritagium cum Johanna filia nostra" by charter dated 16 Apr 1205[269].  &lt;ref name=FMG /&gt;<br />
				Her husband sent her to make peace with the king her father in 1211 when the latter was attacking North Wales.  She was legitimated in 1226: Pope Honorius III gave dispensation to “Joan wife of Leuwelin prince of North Wales, daughter of king John declaring her legitimate, but without prejudice to the king or realm of England”, dated 29 Apr 1226[270].  &lt;ref name=FMG /&gt;<br />
				She and her son David did homage to King Henry III in 1229[271].  &lt;ref name=FMG /&gt;<br />
				The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that "William Bruse was hanged by Llywelyn son of Iorewerth, having been caught in the chamber of the prince with the princess Jannet, daughter of King John and wife of the prince" in 1230[272].  &lt;ref name=FMG /&gt;<br />
				The Annales Cambriæ record the death in 1237 of "domina Johanna filia regis Angliæ et uxor Lewilini principis Walliæ" and her burial "apud Haber"[273].  &lt;ref name=FMG /&gt;<br />
				The Annals of Tewkesbury record the death “III Kal Apr” in 1236 of “domina Johanna Walliæ, uxor Lewelini, filia regis Johannis et reginæ Clemenciæ”[274].  &lt;ref name=FMG /&gt;<br />
				The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that "Dame Joan daughter of king John and the wife of Llywelyn son of Iorwerth" died in Feb 1237 "at the court of Aber and was buried in a new cemetery on the side of the strand which Howel bishop of Llanelwy had consecrated"[275]. &lt;ref name=FMG /&gt;<br />
				Llywelyn and Joan's three children were born beginning 1208.&lt;ref name=FMG /&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1205 Llewelyn Marries Joan===<br />
				About 1203, the English King, having lost a great part of his territories in France, returned into England.  On his arrival, he gave Joan, a daughter, which he had by a lady of the house of Ferres, in marriage to Llewelyn; as a reward for the due observance of the late treaty, or as a means of securing those advantages, which he might think would naturally result from such an alliance.  With this lady, was given as a dower, the lordship of Elesmere in Shropshire.&lt;ref name="warrington"&gt;William Warrington, W., (1823).

Accessed February 16, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				: '''Note''': Joan's mother is the subject of an ongoing historical debate. The only contemporary evidence of the mother's name does not support her being Agatha Ferrers.&lt;ref&gt;The only source that explicitly names Joan's mother is her obit in the Tewkesbury Annals: "Obiit domina Johanna domina Walliae, uxor Lewelini filia regis Johannis et regina Clemencie, iii. kal. Aprilis."

				England followed the church’s teachings in not allowing illegitimate lines to rule, so when Joan had Dafydd ap Llywellyn in 1212 the English backed Dafydd’s right to rule Wales in the place of Gruffydd.  &lt;ref name="ellie"/&gt;<br />
				This was deemed strange to the welsh considering that Llywellyn had twin sons by a concubine Crystyn, Angharad and Tegwarad, who were also older than Dafydd and technically came second and third in line under Welsh law.  &lt;ref name="ellie"/&gt;<br />
				Llywellyn Fawr foreseeing the problems of his two sons, particularly the flaws in Gruffydd, started to work towards declaring Dafydd as his sole heir.  He followed Lord Rhys of Deheubarth’s lead by rewriting Welsh law favouring children born into a church sanctioned marriage to promote Anglo-Welsh negotiations for future descendants.  &lt;ref name="ellie"/&gt;<br />
				After Gruffydd’s death in 1244, Dafydd rules esclusively until his death in 1246, when Gruffydd’s second son Llywellyn ap Gruffydd became effectively the first “Prince of all Wales.”  &lt;ref name="ellie"/&gt;

				===Llywelyn's Other Mistresses===<br />
				The names of the other six mistresses of Prince Llywelyn are not known. &lt;ref name=FMG /&gt;  Prince Llywelyn had five illegitimate children by them.

				==Death of Tangwystl==<br />
				She died Between 1201 and 1209   &lt;ref&gt; Historical novelist Sharon Kay Penman "Falls the Shadow" p. 31, gives death date of Aug. 1201.  Other secondary sources give later dates up to 1209  Cited by Kinship Tree &lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				Cause of death:  Bled to death after a fall brought on premature childbirth. &lt;ref name="kinship"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				Tangwystil died in childbirth.  &lt;ref&gt;https://wuhstry.wordpress.com/2014/10/15/the-stigma-of-illegitimacy-in-medieval-england-and-wales/   Good write up stating the names of some other mistresses &lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				Alternatively, she died March 30, 1226 in Caernarvonshire, Wales and was buried at Llan-Faes, Isle of Anglesey, Wales, United Kingdom&lt;ref name="geni"/&gt;

				==Issue==
				</p>
				<p>
				===Confirmed Issue===<br />
				Gruffydd ap llywelyn was Llywellyn's the oldest child, born in 1196 to his mistress Tangwystl. &lt;ref name="ellie"/&gt;<br />
				Issue of Tangwystl and Llewlyn the Great:[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tw1aAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=llewllyn%20the%20great%20ap%20Iorweth&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]<br />
				* Gruffydd ap Llywelyn[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tw1aAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=llewllyn%20the%20great%20ap%20Iorweth&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] (c.1196-1244) m. [[Caradog-1|Senena]] (dau. of [[Ap_Thomas-16|Caradoc ap Thomas]] of Anglesey). Gruffydd had four sons including [[Gwynedd-19|Llywelyn ap Gruffydd]], who for a period occupied a position in Wales comparable to that of his grandfather, and [[ap_Gruffudd-30|Dafydd ap Gruffydd]] who ruled Gwynedd briefly after his brother's death.  n"By Tangwystl Llewelyn had a son, very brave, called Gryffydd ap Llewelyn; who, as heir apparent, had the Cantrevs of Englefield, Rhos, Rhyvonioc, and Dyffryn Clwyd given him by his father, being the country adjoining to England; in order that the young prince might be induced, by a closer motive of interest, to defend his own territories, from the common enemy the English.  He married, during his father’s life, Sina daughter of Caradoc ap Thomas."&lt;ref name="warrington"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===Possible Issue===<br />
				Tangwystl, the mistress of [[ap_Iorwerth-26|Llywelyn the Great]], was the mother of his son [[ap_Llywelyn-21|Gruffudd]] .  She was also the mother of the following daughters:<br />
				# [[ferch_Llywelyn-5|Gwladus Ddu]] <br />
				# [[Llewellyn-173|Gwenllian]], <br />
				# [[ferch_Llywelyn-5|Margred]] # [[ferch_Llewelyn-1|Ellen]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/handle/2160/5112/gruffudd%20ap%20cynan%204.png?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Gruffudd ap Cynan 4] ([[#Bartrum]])&lt;/ref&gt; Note: William Warrington in 1823 wrote that "Prince Llewelyn, in his youth, had married Tangwystl, daughter of Llywarch Goch the lord of Rhos."&lt;ref name="warrington"&gt;Source: [[#Warrington]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				Llywellyn is known to have had two or three of his children from a mistress called Tangwystl ferch llywarch, who died in childbirth with another of llywellyn’s children.&lt;ref name="ellie"&gt;“Answerellie”, Winchester University History Students’ Blog.  The Stigma of Illegitimacy in Medieval England and Wales.  15 October 2015.  https://wuhstry.wordpress.com/2014/10/15/the-stigma-of-illegitimacy-in-medieval-england-and-wales/   Accessed February 19, 2016. &lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				Llywellyn ap Iorwerth of the House of Aberffaw, and later the House of Gwynedd once he was invested Prince of Wales, had eight children but only two of whom are considered to be born from his wife Joan.&lt;ref name="ellie"&gt;“Answerellie”, Winchester University History Students’ Blog.

				Gruffydd ap Llywelyn[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tw1aAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=llewllyn%20the%20great%20ap%20Iorweth&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] (c.1196-1244)&lt;ref&gt;Llywelyn's eldest son&lt;/ref&gt; m. Senena&lt;ref&gt;dau. of Caradoc ap Thomas of Anglesey.&lt;/ref&gt; Issue.&lt;ref&gt;4 sons including Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, who for a period occupied a position in Wales comparable to that of his grandfather, and Dafydd ap Gruffydd who ruled Gwynedd briefly after his brother's death.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				Some sources state that Tangwystl was the mother of most of Llywelyn's illegitimate children.  Cawley in the Foundation for Medieval Genealogy, however, believes she is only the mother of one child, Gruffydd.  &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt;  #GRUFFYDD (before 1205-Tower of London 1 Mar 1244).  Called "frater primogenitus" of David by Matthew of Paris, when he records that Gruffydd consented to his brother's succession on the death of their father[293].  Lord of Lleyn.  He was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London, dying in an escape attempt[294]. &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt;<br />
				Cawley names several other illegitimate children of LLywelyn who are sometimes thought to be the children of Tangwystl, but whom Cawley believes were the children of up to six other mistresses whose names have become lost.  &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt;<br />
				#Gruffydd ap llywelyn was Llywelly's the oldest child, born in 1196. &lt;ref name="ellie"/&gt;
