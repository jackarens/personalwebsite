				: Note &lt;span id='N2118'&gt;N2118&lt;/span&gt;<br />
				: I-i First Lord of the Manor of Newton<br />
				: <br />
				: 1246 witnessed chareter of Patrick Harang<br />
				: <br />
				: made recognizance of the Marches 1245<br />
				: : Sir Robert de Hyburne, knight, is mentioned in John the Viscount II's chatrer of the monks of Farne, in the reign of King John, as holding land in Newton-by-the-Sea, so that he or his ancestors must have acquired it an an earlier date, either from the Vescys to whom the barony belonged, or from the Muschamps, who were the immediate overlords of the Hepburns or Hebburns of Hebburn in Northumberland. Northumberland now forms the north eastern part of England south of Scotland. However, in the thirteenth century this area was a wild no mans land between the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, well north of Hadrian's Roman Wall and in constant dispute.<br />
				: : Near Chillingham, in Northumberland England, are still to be seen the ruins of an old bastle-house called Hepburn Tower, which is reputedly the original seat of the Hepburns, and nearby are the Hepburn Crags. In the "Minstrelsy of the English Border" there is a ballad by Sheldon entitled "Lord Hepburn". It illustrates very powerfully the lawless character of the old times, when such strongholds as this "old bastle" were necessary for the protection of life and property.<br />
				: : The name of Hepburn is probably a local one derived from these lands in Northumberland. Chalmers in his Caledonia Vol ii p440 indicates the name was probably taken from the village of Hebburn in the Parish of Chillingham, Morpeth ward. <br />
				: : As reported in Douglas's Peerage the House of Hepburn of Hailes in Scotland is traditionally said to have been founded by an Englishman taken prisoner in the reign of King David II, and long detained for non payment of ransom, who, having on one occasion displayed great courage and valour, rescued the Earl of Dunbar and March from a savage horse and was rewarded by the grant of lands in East Lothian, (Hector Boece, Bellenden's Translation, 1536, Book xvi.235b).<br />
				: : Hailes is in East Lothian in Scotland on the Old Edinburgh to Dunbar Road between Haddington and East Linton. The ruins of the Castle at Hailes are still to be seen about two miles west of East Linton where once a ford and now an old bridge crosses the River Tyne.<br />
				: : The Scottish Earls of Dunbar and March, Gospatricks, had originally been Earls of Northumberland, but had been driven out of England after the Norman invasion (1066 and later). They were kindly received by Malcolm Canmore in Scotland who bestowed on the head of the family the Manor of Dunbar.<br />
				: : Being originally a Northumbrian the Earl seems to have had a kindly feeling towards Hepburn his Northumbrian prisoner. Sir Robert de Hepburn was made first lord of the manor Newton and was one of 24 Knights who made Recognisance by oath of the Marches between England and Scotland on 13 October 1245. If born circa 1225 he would have been 20 at this time. Sir Robert can be considered the founding father of the Hepburn family in Scotland.<br />
				: : In Scotland when people refer to highland clans, lowland clans or border clans, we can understand that from earliest times the Hepburn family has been predominant among the border families. Similarly the name Robert keeps appearing in the Hepburn family down through the ages.<br />
				: <br />
				: Sir Robert had two sons, John and Nicholas.<br />
				: : Refer to "Some Family Leaves" by James Alexander Duncan, published 1911 for much of the early family history research.<br />
				: : The main research sources for this family history are "The Genealogical Notes of the Hepburn Family" published privately by Edward Hepburn in 1925 and The Chapter titled "Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell and Duke of Orkney" in "Scots Peerage" edited by Sir James Balfour Paul 1905.<br />
