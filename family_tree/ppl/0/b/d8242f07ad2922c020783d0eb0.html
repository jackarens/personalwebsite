				== Biography ==
				</p>
				<p>
				===1198 Birth and Parentage===<br />
				Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (c. 1198 – 1 March 1244) was the Welsh first-born son of Llywelyn the Great ("Llywelyn Fawr").  His mother Tangwystl probably died in childbirth.&lt;ref name="wiki"&gt; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruffydd_ap_Llywelyn_Fawr Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr. ] Wikipedia.  Accessed Feb 15, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				He was born before 1205. &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt;<br />
				Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was the illegitimate son of Llywelyn ap Iorwerth Fawr ("the Great") Prince of Wales and his mistress Tangwystl of Rhos.  &lt;ref name="fmg"&gt; Cawley, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, Medieval Lands, Foundation for Medieval Genealogy.  http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/WALES.htm#Gruffydddied1244A.  Accessed Feb 15, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (d. 1244 ), prince , natural son of Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (q.v.) by Tangwystl , daughter of Llywarch Goch of Rhos .   &lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt; Professor Thomas Jones Pierce, M.A., F.S.A., (1905-1964), Aberystwyth.  Gruffydd ap Llywelyn.  Dictionary of Welsh Biography.http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-GRUF-APL-1244.html.  Sources:  A History of Wales ;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography ; Littere Wallie , 1940 ;  Calendar of Ancient Correspondence concerning Wales , 1935 .  Accessed February 27, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				He was b. sometime before his father's marriage to Joan (q.v.) in 1206 . &lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1211 Handed over to King John as Hostage===<br />
				The first reference to him is as one of the hostages handed over to John in 1211 ; he was still a prisoner in Aug. 1213 , but was released as part of the general settlement of 1215 . &lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;<br />
				As a boy, Gruffydd was one of the hostages taken by King John of England as a pledge for his father's continued good faith. A clause in the Magna Carta (1215) compelled his release. &lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===Resentment of brother Dafydd===<br />
				Irresponsible and headstrong, Gruffydd openly resented the fact that his half-brother ( Dafydd ap Llywelyn , q.v. ), was intended to be Llywelyn 's sole successor, an injustice which, in mediaeval Wales , an acknowledged son, though illegitimate by normal standards, could challenge with reasonable hope of public support. It was not Llywelyn 's intention, however, to exclude him entirely, if he proved co-operative, from some share of power. &lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1218  Marriage to Senena===<br />
				Gruffydd married Senana who was possibly a daughter of Caradoc ap Thomas of Anglesey.  &lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;<br />
				1218 is an estimated year of marriage based on an estimated age of 20 at marriage.
				</p>
				<p>
				===1220 Possible alternate marriage===<br />
				Gruffydd had a son named Llywelyn.  According to several non-contemporary Welsh genealogical tracts, the mother of Llywelyn was Rhanullt, an otherwise unknown daughter of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. If correct, these sources could indicate that Gruffydd married a daughter of Rǫgnvaldr in about 1220. &lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;<br />
				Contemporary sources, however, show that Llywelyn's mother was Senena, an undoubted wife of Gruffydd. &lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1228-1234 Imprisonment at Degannwy===<br />
				Although he suffered a long term of imprisonment at Degannwy from 1228 to 1234 , after having been deprived of the lordships of Ardudwy and Merioneth , he was eventually made lord of Llŷn and given the extensive appanage of Upper Powys , in Llywelyn 's hands since the death of Gwenwynwyn (q.v.) .&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1240:  Father's Death and Support for Brother===<br />
				On the death of Gruffudd's father llywelyn in 1240, under Welsh law, Gruffudd would have been entitled to consideration as his father's successor. Llywelyn however had excluded him from the succession and had declared Dafydd, his son by his wife Joan, to be heir to the kingdom. Llywelyn went to great lengths to strengthen Dafydd's position, probably aware that there would be considerable Welsh support for Gruffydd against the half-English Dafydd.  &lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1240  Prisoner of Dafydd===<br />
				Llywelyn's father, [[Llywelyn-30|Gruffydd]], and his brother, Owain, were initially kept prisoner by Dafydd, then transferred into the custody of King Henry III of England. &lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywelyn_the_Last Llywelyn the Last]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				The Annals of Dunstable record that “David” imprisoned “fratrem suum majorem, ex alia matre oriundum” after the death of their father in 1240[312].  The primary source which confirms her name has not yet been identified.  &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1240 Prisoner of Brother Dafydd at Criccieth===<br />
				It was Dafydd himself, during his father's last enfeebled years, who struck a final blow for the principles of legitimacy and primogeniture, stripping Gruffydd of all his territories and imprisoning him and Owain ap Gruffydd (q.v.) , his eldest son, at Criccieth . This last event occurred in the period just before Llywelyn d. ( April 1240 ) or immediately afterwards. &lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1241 Senena's agreement with Henry III===<br />
				On 12 Aug. 1241 , Senena , Gruffydd 's wife, entered into an agreement with Henry III , arranging for her husband's release and restoration. When, a fortnight later, Dafydd was obliged to submit to the king at Gwern Eigron , the first part only of the agreement was fulfilled, for Gruffydd was now made a prisoner in the Tower of London where for over three years he spent an easy confinement in the company of his wife and some of their children, a pawn in the game of Anglo-Welsh politics. His attempt to escape on 1 March 1244 had a fatal ending. &lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;<br />
				Gruffydd was held a prisoner by his brother Dafydd when the latter took over Gwynedd. &lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;<br />
				Henry III King of England made an agreement with "Senana wife of Griffin son of Llewellyn…whom David his brother keeps in prison with Owen his son" for payment of a ransom for their release, agreeing to give "David and Rothery her sons as hostages" to the king, dated 12 Aug 1241[316]. &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt;<br />
				Gruffydd's wife, Senana (possibly a daughter of Caradoc ap Thomas of Anglesey), agreed to pay Henry 600 marks for the release of her husband and their eldest son, Owain, and to hand over her two youngest sons, Dafydd and Rhodri, to the king as hostages to ensure that she kept her part of the bargain. &lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;<br />
				Henry did not keep his part however, and kept Gruffydd and his son imprisoned as "guests" because this continued to give him the possibility of using Gruffydd as a weapon against his brother.&lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1241  Prisoner of Henry III===<br />
				Following a successful invasion of the Welsh borders by King Henry III of England in 1241, Dafydd was obliged to hand over Gruffydd into the king's custody, he was then taken to London and imprisoned in the Tower of London. &lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1244 Death===
				</p>
				<p>
				Gruffudd died at the Tower of London 1 Mar 1244.  &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt;<br />
				The Annales Cambriæ record that "Grifinus filius Lewelini" was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1244 and died while attempting to escape[313].  &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt;<br />
				Matthew of Paris records that he was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London, dying in an escape attempt[314].  &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt;<br />
				The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that "Gruffudd son of Llywelyn attempted to escape from the king´s prison in London by throwing a rope through the window of the tower, and descending along the rope, but the rope breaking, he fell and broke his neck" in 1244[315]. &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt;<br />
				His body was discovered by the Yeoman of the Guard the next morning at the foot of the White Tower where he had fallen some 90 feet (27 m). The window from which he made his descent is on the south side of the Tower on the top floor. It was bricked up afterwards and can still be seen today.<br />
				[[Llywelyn-30|Gruffydd]] died in 1244, from a fall while trying to escape from his cell at the top of the Tower of London. The window from which he attempted to escape the Tower was bricked up and can still be seen to this day.&lt;ref name="wiki"&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywelyn_the_Last Llywelyn the Last]&lt;/ref&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===1248 Burial at Aberconway===<br />
				In 1248 his remains were conveyed to Wales and laid to rest at Aberconway .&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;<br />
				In 1248, the abbots of Strata Florida and Aberconwy arranged for the return of his body to Wales, where he was buried at Aberconwy with his father.&lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				==Issue==
				</p>
				<p>
				Gruffydd &amp; his wife had five children: &lt;ref name="fmg"/&gt;<br />
				He had four sons — Owain Goch (q.v.) , Llywelyn (q.v.) , Dafydd (q.v.) and Rhodri — and one daughter, Gwladus , who m. Rhys ap Rhys Mechyll . &lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;<br />
				After his death Gruffydd's four sons—Owain, Llywelyn, Dafydd and Rhodri—would come into their own, and after much fraternal discord, Llywelyn ended up ruling most of Wales. He also had three daughters, Gwladus, Catherine and Margred.  &lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;<br />
