				== Biography ==While there is conjecture in previous generations of William both Balfour Paul&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/570/mode/2up page 571]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sir Bruce Gordon Seton&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] Sir Bruce Gordon Seton; [https://archive.org/stream/houseofsetonstv100seto#page/102/mode/2up page 103]&lt;/ref&gt; come to agreement in the line of the Lords of Seton with William and provide that he was the son of [[De_Wyntown-1|Alan de Wyntoun]] and [[De_Seton-13|Margaret de Seton]].  Given the inaccuracies in Maitland's work&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Sir Richard Maitland, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofhouseof00maitrich#page/26/mode/2up page 27]&lt;/ref&gt; that source is generally discounted unless specific mention is required.<br />
				Given the events surrounding the abduction and marriage of his mother can be dated to about 1347, William, presumed to be the eldest child, is estimated to have been born in 1348.<br />
				His father is believed, at around 1360, to have "taken the cross" and journeyed to the Holy Land to seek forgiveness for his sins.  There is a record of a deposit in London on his way abroad, where Alan de Wyntoun left 400 ducats of gold with one Nicholas Zucull a Venetian merchant.  In 1363 his son "William of Wyntoun" authorised Adam Wymondham a citizen, and Nicholas Nogrebon, a Venetian to recover the money.  The document states that Alan had died on his way to Mount Sinai, when about to visit the tomb of St. Katherine there.&lt;ref&gt;Rotuli Scotiae; Vol.  1. No. 879&lt;/ref&gt;  He likely died in Venice.  It can be presumed, as William had others act in his stead, that he was not then of age and also that, as he was using the patronymic his mother was still alive.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Holy Land===He appears to have followed his father to the Holy Land and, according to Fordun&lt;ref&gt;Fordun; Scotichronicon; vol. II. p. 337 and also noted in Douglas Peerage&lt;/ref&gt; taken part in the Holy Wars and to have reached Jerusalem.  Although Sir Bruce Gordon Seton speculates that this placed him with the army of Peter I, King of Cyprus, who was fighting in Palestine in 1369, this is incorrect.  Peter was assassinated on 17 Jan 1369 by one of his bodyguard in his bed at Nicosia.  It is possible that he joined other Scottish Knights on the Alexandrian Crusade of 1365 but he must have been young and a squire.  There was no fighting in Palestine around these dates.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Return to Affairs in Scotland===He is back in Scotland at some point prior to 1380.  He is noticed in a series of Charters, being designed, as Lord of that Ilk and of Tranent when he granted the lands of Wester Fausyde to John de Fausyde, his esquire, presumably with him on his overseas venture.  He seems to have granted certain lands in Longniddrie to John Maitland and John de Paynston by charter confirmed by King Robert II. 18 January 1381.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Battle of Otterburn===He is mentioned by Froissart&lt;ref&gt;Froissart: Chronicles (Ed 1839), vol. II, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; as "le seigneur de "Seton", in the Scottish Force which raided England in August 1388 as a reply to the invasion of Scotland and the burning of Edinburgh by Richard II three years before.  In retiring from Durham the column, under [[Douglas-1006|James Douglas]]. 2nd Earl of Douglas met "Hotspur" on 19 August at [[:Category:Battle of Otterburn|Otterburn]].  The English were routed and Hotspur was taken; but Douglas was killed.  William was in this force but not then a knight.<br />
				In 1394, on 27 Oct, he is styled "Baron, Lord of Seton" in a petition to the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. of Papal Reg., Petitions, 1342-1419, Rec. ser., p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===Marriage of his Sister - Christiana===This event, noticed by Sir Bruce Gordon Seton, &lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] Sir Bruce Gordon Seton; [https://archive.org/stream/houseofsetonstv100seto#page/102/mode/2up page 103]&lt;/ref&gt; provides that Christiana had married George Dunbar, 10th Earl of Dunbar, and had a daughter Elizabeth.  On 28 August 1395 Pope Benedict XIII. (Antipope) ordered a dispensation to be granted to David, Earl of Carrick (afterwards Duke of Rothesay), firstborn of Robert, King of Scotland, and Elizabeth, daughter of George Dunbar, Earl of March (and of Dunbar), who, knowing themselves to be in the third degree of consanguinity had contracted espousals per verba de futuro, the King's consent being first obtained (Regesta Avinionensia, 280, f. 3236).  On 11 March 1396-97 a commission was issued by the same Pope to grant dispensation to the same persons, who had married without banns, copula subsecuta (Ibid., 303, f. 4896). This seems to show that the prince and Elizabeth Dunbar were married, and not only betrothed.  The insult to the Earl of Dunbar and his family by the Prince's repudiation of Elizabeth was thus much greater than has hitherto been stated.  Then David married Marjorie Douglas, daughter of Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas.<br />
				Infuriated at this insult Dunbar, who had "been one of the Scottish leaders at Otterburn, went over to the English Court and became a bitter enemy of the house of Douglas and of his own country".  In one act of irresponsibility David Stewart divided the country and one of Scotland's greatest leaders sided with the enemy.  Thousands of Scots will die as a result of this. <br />
				===Knighthood and the [[:Category:Battle of Homildon Hill|Battle of Homildon Hill]]===In 1402, 14 May. he is designed Knight in a charter of the lands of Borde granted by him in favour of Patrick Fleming.&lt;ref&gt;Wigton Charter chest; copy in H.M. Gen. Reg. Ho.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				In 1402,  Scottish nobles launched a coordinated invasion of Northern England, led by Sir Patrick Hepburn, Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton and Robert de Lawedre of Edrington.  In the initial foray, some 12,000 Scottish troops crossed into Cumberland and looted areas near Carlisle.  On 22 June at Nisbet, Berwickshire, George de Dunbar, 10th Earl of March, William's brother-in-law, and now forfeited, successfully led 200 English soldiers, mainly drawn from the garrison at Berwick-upon-Tweed, against 400 Scots returning from a raid on Northumberland.  The Scots were slaughtered including the death of Sir Patrick Hepburn, younger of Hailes; and the capture of Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton, Robert de Lawedre of Edrington, Sir John Cockburn and Sir Thomas Haliburton.<br />
				Using Nisbit Moor as a pretext, Sir Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas, now arguably the most militarily powerful man in Scotland, and a key part of the Duke of Albany's administration, launched a punitive expedition into England.  With Murdoch Stewart, Earl of Fife, Duke of Albany's son, Douglas's army marched as far as Newcastle to avenge the battle.  At the head of 10,000 men he laid waste to the whole of Northumberland.  In this force was Sir William Seton.<br />
				George Dunbar, with intimate knowledge of the force characteristics, persuaded Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, and his son Harry "Hotspur" to lie in wait for the returning Scots at Wooler.  Once Douglas's men had made camp at Millfield, relatively low ground, the English army rushed to attack.  While the Scots army was disciplined enough to retreat to the higher ground of Homildon hill they organised into traditional Schiltron formations, by then an outdated formation and vulnerable to indirect fire.  The Schiltrons presented a large target for the English Longbowmen, and the formations started to break.   It has been suggested that Douglas hesitated to signal the advance of his main force, and when he did, it was too little too late.  Douglas's mauled army met the as yet unbloodied English men at arms, and were routed.  Many of Douglas's leading captains were captured, including his kinsman George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus, Thomas Dunbar, 5th Earl of Moray and Murdoch Stewart, Earl of Fife, Albany's son.  Douglas himself was captured having been wounded five times, including the loss of an eye.  Amongst those captured was Sir William Seton.  "Le Sieur de Seton" was taken to the Tower&lt;ref&gt;Bain's; Calendar of Documents IV 403.&lt;/ref&gt; and was still there as late as 1406.&lt;ref&gt;Bain's; Calendar of Documents IV 727.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				Sir Bruce Gordon Seton mentions that his son John "appears to have been taken prisoner with him, and there is no record of the date of their release".  The source material, Bain's Calendar of Documents, provides "le Sieur de Seton" which could imply a son but mentions William as being at the Tower; there is only mention of one Seton and not two.  It could be presumed this to be William.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Back in Scotland===He was back in Scotland by 1408 when a charter of confirmation was granted at Perth, 27 March 1408, by Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, as Regent, ratifying the grant of an annual rent made by William de Seton, Knight, with consent of the Duke's beloved cousin, John de Seton, Knight, his son and heir, to Walter de Haliburton of Dirleton, in consideration of the transfer to the said William of the gift of the ward and marriage of Elizabeth de Gordon, daughter and heir of the deceased Adam Gordon, Knight (he was killed at the [[:Category:Battle of Homildon Hill|Battle of Homildon Hill]]).
				</p>
				<p>
				===Death===Sir William Seton died before March 1410, and was buried 'in the Cordelere (Franciscan) freiris at Haddington,'.  He left to them six loads of coal weekly out of his pit at Tranent, and forty shillings annually out of his estate of Barns to ensure an easy passage.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Family===Sir William is known to have married Janet Fleming, elder daughter of Sir David Fleming of Biggar.&lt;ref&gt;Registrum de Panmure II. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;  The date of his marriage is not provided.  There are suggestions that he had a previous marriage but there appears no source material for this.  Certainly his second son was born to Janet.  It can be assumed, as his oldest son married in 1393, that his marriage occurred about 1370.<br />
				Both Balfour Paul and Sir Bruce Gordon Seton provide that he had two sons and a daughter:<br />
				* [[Seton-108|John Seton]]; who will inherit and Lord of Seton.  He will marry, before 8 March 1393, Catherine de Sanct Clar, said to have been daughter of Sir William Sinclair of Herdmanston.  In can be presumed that John was born about 1370.<br />
				* [[Seton-5|Alexander Seton]].  In 1406, Alexander was the one responsible for the murder of [[Fleming-323|Sir David Fleming of Biggar]], his grandfather.  In 1408, William Seton, holding the ward and gift of marriage of Elizabeth Gordon, daughter and heir of the deceased Sir Adam Gordon, Knight, Lord of Gordon, arranged the marriage between them.  On 20 July 1408 the spouses had a charter of the lands of the bride's late father in Berwickshire and Aberdeen shire.  From this marriage are descended the Earls and Marquesses of Huntly and Dukes of Gordon, the Earls of Sutherland after the year 1500, the Setons of Meldrum, Touch, Abercorn, Pitmedden and Mounie, and the Gordons of Gight, Letterfourie, Cluny, and many others.  In might be presumed that Alexander was born about 1375.<br />
				* [[De_Seton-12|Janet Seton]].  Both principal sources mention that she married, before 3 March 1414, George Dunbar, the son and apparent heir to George Dunbar, Earl of March.   Balfour Paul does not notice this when discussing the Earls of Dunbar.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 3, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun03pauluoft#page/276/mode/2up page 276]&lt;/ref&gt;  Given the date suggested the "son and heir apparent" could only have been George de Dunbar, 11th Earl of Dunbar &amp; 2nd of March, therefore a nephew.  But he was certainly of age in 1385, seems to have married in 1390 and is thought to have married a lady named Beatrix, otherwise unknown, who died before 1421, when he had a dispensation to marry Alicia Hay, daughter of Sir William Hay of Yester, though it is doubtful if this marriage took place.  An event is certainly on record and her tocher, of 300 merks, was discharged by "John, Lord Settone", stated as her brother.&lt;ref&gt;Harleian MSS. 4693. fol. 8b.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a son, George, who must therefore have been the son and heir to George Dunbar, Earl of March and it must refer to a marriage to him.  They both likely born about 1385/90 and this is depicted on wikitree.<br />
				No further children appear in Sir Bruce Gordon Seton's work or Balfour Paul and thus not produced here.<br />
				Maitland&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Sir Richard Maitland, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofhouseof00maitrich#page/26/mode/2up page 27]&lt;/ref&gt; credits Sir William with six other daughters, but does not include Janet, nor does he provide Alexander.  
				</p>
				<p>
				He offers:<br />
				* The eldeft dochter of the faid Lord Williame was mareit on the lord Dernlie, foirbearto the erle of Lenox; but this is incorrect and did not happen for another two generations.<br />
				* the fecund on the lord Kennedye, foirbear to the erle of Caffillis (Cassilis).  Given the dates this must have been James kennedy of Dunure but he married Mary Stewart, daughter of the King so this cannot be correct either.
				</p>
				<p>
				* the thrid on the foirbear of the lord Ogilvy.
				</p>
				<p>
				* the fourt on the foirbear of the lord Carlill.
				</p>
				<p>
				* the fyft on Halden lard of Glennegis.<br />
				* the fext on Hammiltoun lard of Preftoun.  The Hamiltons did not hold Preston until after Sir John Hamilton IV of Fingalton married, as his second wife, Jane, daughter of Sir James Liddell of Preston about 1400.  He was succeeded sometime before 1438 by his son Sir James Hamilton.  He married an Agnes Hamilton and had a son and two daughters.  There is no notice that they married a Seton.  This is possibly noticed in many sources available as [[De_Seton-9|Anna Seton]] that marries [[Hamilton-4768|John Hamilton]].  She has been disconnected from this family pending original source material as Maitland is inaccurate.  Unfortunately his inaccuracy has been copied into other material such as The Peerage.
				</p>
				<p>
				* the fewint on Lauder lard of Poppill<br />
				He gives the traditional account of their marriages, which seems to be unconfirmed by record evidence, and his account is proved erroneous in at least three instances, including where the marriage of a Seton lady to Sir Alan Stewart of Darnley, which he includes, will be found occurring two generations later.  It seems that he combined William and his grandson in his biography of the family as he does not include [[Seton-15|William Seton]] in his work.

				===Arms of Sir William Seton===Sir William's arms are depicted in the "Armorial de Gelre" ([http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Folio_64v_de_l%27Armorial_de_Gelre Folio 64v] and provided on this page).   Guillaume de Seton; "D'or, à trois croissants de gueules, dans un double trêcheur fleuronné et contre-fleuronné du même. Cimier : Une tête de bouquetin d'hermine, accornée d'or."<br />
				In 1384 his seal still showed an antelope's head as crest; but, about 1400, he substituted a single crescent between two plumes issuant from a "ducal crown".  This still exists on a stone over the South door of Seton Church.  Although not shown in the Armorial de Gelre he had lions as supporters in 1384.
