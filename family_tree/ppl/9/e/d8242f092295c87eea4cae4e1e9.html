				== Biography of Laurence Abernethy ==<br />
				*The Laurence Abernethy, represented on this Profile, is the son of [[Abernathy-223|Orm Abernethy]], Lay Abbot of the Culdee Monastery at Abernethy, in the Earldom of Strathearn.  This line of Abernethy, later Lord Saltoun, is discussed by Sir James Balfour Paul, The Scots Peerage, Volume 7, between pages 396 and 416.  Laurence de Abernethy starting page 398.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Sir James Balfour Paul; [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun07pauluoft#page/398/mode/2up  Vol. 7, page 398]&lt;/ref&gt;  <br />
				*While Sir James Balfour Paul suggests his lineage is obscure, it is defined within a Charter&lt;ref&gt;North Berwick Carte, no. 3, noticed on [http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/factoid/28450/ People of Medieval Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;, dated to between 1160 and 1172, where Orm is stated to be the father of Laurence and the son of Aed (Hugh/Hugo), son of Aed (Hugh/Hugo), son of Gillemichel earl of Fife (d. c. 1135).  This line were the hereditary lay abbots of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culdees Culdee] monastery of [http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/27936/details/abernethy+culdees+monastery/ Abernethy], in Strathearn (later Fife and now Perth and Kinross).&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Sir James Balfour Paul; [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun07pauluoft#page/396/mode/2up  Vol. 7, page 396]&lt;/ref&gt; This Laurence was the last to hold the office of Lay Abbot of Abernethy, as he quitclaimed his right, but later held the lands of the Monastery as Lord.  Lay Abbots were, not necessarily religious, appointed to manage the estates of, in this case, the Monastery.  The Abernethy family had assumed heritable rights some time prior to 1150 but gave them up c. 1190.  The implications of this Charter indicate that both Orm and Laurence, this Profile, were alive, although Laurence may not have been of age, at the time of the Charter.<br />
				*Gillemichael is noticed in The Scots Peerage&lt;ref&gt;The Scots Peerage; Sir James Balfour Paul; [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun04pauluoft#page/4/mode/2up  Vol. 4, page 4]&lt;/ref&gt; although his lineage is obscure.  He is known to have had children, two sons; Duncan and Hugh, and a daughter at least, and was, as Earl of Fife one of the most important and influential nobles in Scotland.  Sir James Balfour Paul is of the view that "it is not improbable that the territorial earldom became for the first time hereditary to him and his heirs".&lt;ref&gt;The Scots Peerage; Sir James Balfour Paul; [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun04pauluoft#page/4/mode/2up  Vol. 4, page 4]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hugh is known to have had a son Hugh thus providing the connection to the Charter mentioned above.  However to confuse the issue regarding lineage Hugh, son of Gillemichael, was know to have had a son Orm.  This is noticed in the People of Medieval Scotland, in relation to the same Charter where they caution genealogists regarding confusion on lineage.<br />
				*The Hugh, son of Hugh, son of Gillemichael, may also be the ancestor to the family of Wemyss, later Earls of Wemyss.  Hugh held the lands of Markinch and is said to have been the father of John of Methil, who was the undoubted ancestor of the family of Wemyss.&lt;ref&gt;The Scots Peerage; Sir James Balfour Paul; [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/474/mode/2up  Vol. 8, page 474]&lt;/ref&gt;  However Sir James Balfour Paul mentions that the father of John of Methil was not Hugh but a Michael of Methil, whose kinship with the Earls of Fife is not clearly proved.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Points of Conjecture===*In his work, "The peerage of Scotland: containing an historical and genealogical account of the nobility of that kingdom...", Sir Robert Douglas provides&lt;ref&gt;The peerage of Scotland: containing an historical and genealogical account of the nobility of that kingdom; Sir Robert Douglas; [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004896980.0001.000/1:8?rgn=div1;view=fulltext Abernethy, Lord Abernethy]&lt;/ref&gt; that Orm had a son, Laurence, later lord Abernethy, that married a daughter of Henry Rule of Balmerino, who made a donation of the patronage of the church of Abernethy to the monastery of Arbroath; and legated to the canons regular of St. Andrews ten shillings yearly, payable out of his lands of Bambreich, with consent of Sir Patrick Abernethy his son and heir.  He is noticed in a Charter providing "to Laurence, son of Orme, son of Hugh, etc" mentioned prior.<br />
				*However, The Scots Peerage, by Sir James Balfour Paul, suggests that he married a Devorguile.  His name and that of his wife Devorguile are recorded as visitors to the shrine of St. Cuthbert at Durham early in the thirteenth century, but it is not known who she was.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Sir James Balfour Paul; [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun07pauluoft#page/398/mode/2up  Vol. 7, page 398]&lt;/ref&gt;   Sir James Balfour Paul, who uses Douglas as source, must have noticed this but makes no mention.  He also notices a William, son of Orm, as a witness to a charter to the Abbey of Arbroath between 1204 and 1211; William must have been a brother to Laurence.<br />
				*It is difficult to date the birth and marriage events.  However it is known that Hugh, the second son, was likely of age in 1233 when he receives a grant of the lands of Oxton and Lyleston, Lauderdale.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Sir James Balfour Paul; [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun07pauluoft#page/398/mode/2up  Vol. 7, page 399]&lt;/ref&gt;  
				</p>
				<p>
				===Known Events===*There is a Charter, dated to c. 1190, where Laurence, as the son of Orm, quitclaims, to Arbroath Abbey, in perpetuity, all right which he had, or which he could claim, to the advowson of the church of Abernethy.  The céli De of Abernethy, clearly still in existence at this point, were granted the other half of the teinds.  This Charter provides that he gives his rights to the demense lands of Abernethy, including Mugdrum, Carpow, Balehyrewell, Balecolly and Innernethy to the céli De of Abernethy.&lt;ref&gt;RRS, iii, no. 69 Cited from [http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/factoid/22185/  People of Medieval Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is, at this point, he gives up any hereditary right to the Monastery of Abernethy and, it also appears, any property rights to Abernethy.  He does not appear to hold title at this point but is later noticed as Lord of Inverarity. <br />
				*On the 15 May 1222, King Alexander II grants to Laurence, son of Orm, the forest of Dunlappie (in Angus).&lt;ref&gt;Arbroath Liber, i, no. 35 Cited from [http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/source/4344/  People of Medieval Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;  This Charter indicates that these lands was held by Orm to both King Malcolm and King William, stated as father to Alexander, thus held to the Crown c. 1150.<br />
				*There is a Charter of Confirmation, by King Alexander II, to Laurence, son of Orm, son of Hugh to the lands of Glenduckie (in Fife) and Balmeadie (in Fife).  This Charter is dated 5 April 1223.<br />
				*Around the same time, Laurence, Lord of Inverarity, son of Orm (of Abernethy), resolves a dispute regarding lands in Angus.&lt;ref&gt;Stair Society Misc V, App. 3/229/1 Cited from [http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/source/4746/  People of Medieval Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				*In 1237 he appears, as Laurence of Abernethy, in the discussions between Scotland and Cardinal Otto, the papal legate, in regards to the Treaty of York.&lt;ref&gt;RRS, iii, no. 259 Cited from [http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/factoid/24840/  People of Medieval Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				*Around 1240 there is a Charter where Laurence of Abernethy, with the wish and consent of his son and heir, Patrick, provides a grant to the St Andrews Priory from the rents of his manor at Ballinbreich (in Fife). &lt;ref&gt;St Andrews Liber, 268 Cited from [http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/factoid/48752/  People of Medieval Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;  For this the Priory quitclaimed to him all right that they had in a toft, 4 acres of land, and a fishery in his villa of Ballinbreich by gift of his mother.  This Charter is interesting as it indicates that his eldest son, Patrick, was of age but that Laurence held the titles and rights.  It also provides that parts of Ballinbriech was provided to the Priory by his mother and thus it may be possible to trace.<br />
				*In 1244 he is noticed in the work by Matthew Paris&lt;ref&gt;Chronica Majora, Volume IV; pp. 381-385.  Cited in Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers; pp. 355 and 356.&lt;/ref&gt; as being witness to an agreement between Alexander II. and Henry III..  This must reflect the Treaty of Newcastle signed that year.<br />
				*Late in his life, Laurence lived as a secular Baron at Kerpal (Carpow, now in Perth and Kinross, then in Fife), the old mansion of the lords of Abernethy and is thought to have lived to an old age.  Sir James Balfour Paul suggests he died shortly after 1244&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Sir James Balfour Paul; [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun07pauluoft#page/398/mode/2up  Vol. 7, page 398]&lt;/ref&gt;, however his eldest son, Patrick, died before him and he is known to have died in 1254.  Thus wikitree has estimated he died c. 1260.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Key Assertions===Based on the history outlined above it is clear that Laurence de Abernethy was born c. 1160 and died c. 1260.  An unusually long time for this period.  There are a number of critical assertions:<br />
				: That this relates to a single Laurence de Abernethy and that Laurence, son of Orm, and Laurence de Abernethy are the same person.
