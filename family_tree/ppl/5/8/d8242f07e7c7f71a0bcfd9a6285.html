			<h4>Narrative</h4>
			<div class="grampsstylednote">
				<p>
				[[Category:Battle of Methven]]<br />
				-----<br />
				==Biography==This Profile relates to the Sir Christopher Seton, friend and supporter of Robert Bruce; saving his life at the Battle of Methven.  He married Lady Christian Bruce, as her second husband, sister of Robert Bruce.   Please take care with merging profiles in this line and seek advice from Profile Managers if in doubt, quoting original source material.  There is considerable confusion, generated by poor genealogical research in the early members of the Seton families. <br />
				It is clear, from analysis of the Charter record, that Sir Christopher Seton did not hold the lands of the Barony of Seton, in Scotland, and these were held, contemporarily, by another family of Seton.  He was not part of the Scottish family of Seton and there has been no genealogical link found between these two family lines outside of legend.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Divergence in Source Material===There is divergence with the major source material for this family; The Scots peerage : founded on Wood's ed. of Sir Robert Douglas's Peerage of Scotland; Sir James Balfour Paul, Volume 8,&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; The Scots peerage, Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/562/mode/2up page 563]&lt;/ref&gt; who maintains that the Lord of Seton prior to [[Seton-206|Sir Alexander Seton]] was, possibly, another Alexander, son of Sir Seyer de Seton; while The House of Seton. A study of lost causes; Sir Bruce Gordon Seton&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] Sir Bruce Gordon Seton; The House of Seton [https://archive.org/stream/houseofsetonstv100seto#page/84/mode/2up page 85]&lt;/ref&gt; maintains that the predecessor was Sir Christopher Seton, although does not define the relationship.  Wikitree research has found no family connection between the two.<br />
				In a further anomaly there is no record of Sir Christopher Seton on the Parliamentary Records suggesting he did not sit in that Parliamant, indeed there was no Seton until [[Seton-206|Sir Alexander Seton]] in 1314.  On the database associated with the People of Medieval Scotland, he is recorded as Christopher of Seton, brother in law to King Robert.&lt;ref&gt;People of medieval Scotland [http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/person/16528/ Christopher of Seton, brother-in-law of King Robert]&lt;/ref&gt;   Christopher Seton also appears in Bain's work "Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland 1272 - 1307", further supporting the English supposition.<br />
				Sir James Balfour Paul does not provide any material associated with Sir Christopher, other than in notes, as he identifies him as English, and thus Sir Bruce Gordon Seton's work is used as the basis for his biography.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] Sir Bruce Gordon Seton; The House of Seton [https://archive.org/stream/houseofsetonstv100seto#page78/mode/2up page 78]&lt;/ref&gt;  
				</p>
				<p>
				===Conjecture with Wikipedia===There are two Profiles on wikipedia that impact the discussion; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Seton Christopher Seton]; and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartnait,_Earl_of_Mar Gartnait, Earl of Mar].  Both are poorly referenced and both provide further conjecture that is not discussed within them.  However the Seton article agrees with the English lineage and the lack of relationship to the Scottish line.<br />
				It states that Christian Bruce did not marry Gartnait, Earl of Mar, but does not discuss the anomaly with other source material, Sir James Balfour Paul being but one.&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Balfour Paul; The Scots peerage, Vol 5, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun05pauluoft#page/578/mode/2up page 579]&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems clear that this supposition is derived from an old family attempt to suggest that Sir Christopher had a child, Alexander, that became Lord of Seton.  This has been proved false and Sir Christopher had no children.  Further, Robert Bruce, as Earl of Carrick, later King of Scotland, was custodian of Kildrummy castle, the seat of the Earldom of Mar in 1305.  Balfour Paul surmises, with credibility, that this was because his sister, now a widow, and children were at the castle.  It also seems highly probable that this was the event that gave rise to Seton marrying his sister as Seton was with Bruce at this time.  Wikitree has retained the sourced link and dates.<br />
				Wikipedia provides that the Seton lands in Yorkshire and Cumberland "had long served the Bruces in Yorkshire".  There is no charter record of this.  While there was a family connection the Seton estates were part of the Barony of Stokeley, held to William de Latimer.  There was clearly a family relationship as [[De_Ireby-2|Christiana de Ireby]], daughter and heiress of Sir William de Ireby, of Ireby, Cumbria, second wife to [[Bruce-517|Robert Bruce]], the father to King Robert, held the manors of Gamelesby and Unthank for life, by a grant of John de Seton, father to Sir Christopher.  Why she obtained these lands from Seton is not clear.<br />
				Wikipedia states, but without authority, that Seton was with Bruce at Greyfriars at the murder of John Comyn providing "Sir Christopher struck down Sir John's uncle, Sir Robert Comyn".  This is believable and is a pity it lacks source.<br />
				Wikipedia also states that Sir Christopher was not at Methven stating him to be at Loch Doon Castle.  Although not a significant issue for genealogists, wikitree has agreed with the majority of near contemporary source and placed him at Methven in accordance with the legend.  That he escaped to Loch Doon, as discussed in most source, is thought likely and, as a strategic Bruce castle, where his wife might reasonable be.  It is quite clear from source material that the castle at Loch Doon was held by Gilbert of Carrick, not by Christopher Seton, as Bruce is known to have forgiven Gilbert for the capture of Seton.&lt;ref&gt;People of Medieval Scotland, [http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/source/6836/; H1/53/5] &lt;/ref&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===Birth===He is stated to have been 21 before 25 March 1299 thus born before 1278, the son of [[Seton-244|Sir John Seton]] of Hinderwell in Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Bain; Calendar of documents relating to Scotland; Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/276/mode/2up No. 1091, page 276]&lt;/ref&gt;  His father died shortly before 11 Sep 1299.  He does not appear in the Homage Rolls, although his father does, suggesting that he was under age at the time.<br />
				Sir Bruce Gordon Seton provides&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] Sir Bruce Gordon Seton; The House of Seton [https://archive.org/stream/houseofsetonstv100seto#page/78/mode/2up page 79]&lt;/ref&gt; that the grandmother of Sir Christopher was descended from Odard de Hodelmia in Dumfriesshire, seemingly the same estate that will later be forfeit.  He provides that his mother, Erminia de Lascelles, was the daughter, and heiress, of Thomas de Lascelles and [[De_Ireby-2|Christian de Treby]]; the Lady that married Robert de Brus the "Competitor", as his second wife.  Her mother was Christian de Hodeholme, daughter, and presumably heiress, of Odard de Hodeholme. 
				</p>
				<p>
				====Discussion====Sir Bruce Gordon Seton uses the above discussion, on lineage, to justify his position that Sir Christopher was Lord of Seton, in Scotland, and head of the Scottish house.  It is clearly not the case.  There is no record he held lands in East Lothian although these are already raised as a Barony.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Events===In 1299, September 11, he appears at the inquest into the estate of Sir John Seton in Cumberland where he is stated to be the son and heir.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Bain; Calendar of documents relating to Scotland; Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/276/mode/2up No. 1091, page 276]&lt;/ref&gt;  This Charter record notices, amongst others that he held the manor of Seton, located in the Barony of Stokeley in Yorkshire, to William de Latimer and his wife, Lucia, for one quarter of a knight's fee.  On 4 Oct, 1299, having performed homage for his father's lands to Edward I his lands are delivered to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Bain; Calendar of documents relating to Scotland; Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/278/mode/2up No. 1102, page 279]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				In 1300, June 13, he is noticed in a distribution of lands in England, suggesting he was still with Edward I.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Bain; Calendar of documents relating to Scotland; Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/290/mode/2up No. 1140, page 291]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				In 1304, March 3, he was with King Edward I at Lochmaben and was provided security to travel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Bain; Calendar of documents relating to Scotland; Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/382/mode/2up No. 1164, page 382]&lt;/ref&gt;  As Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, and John Seagrave are mentioned in the next Charter it might be presumed they were all together.<br />
				In 1305, May 26, there is a pardon to Adam de Twynham for receiving lands from Christopher de Seton without leave of the king, the lands being held to the king.  The lands are noted as 32 acres at Kirkandres.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Bain; Calendar of documents relating to Scotland; Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/464/mode/2up No. 1717, page 464]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				In 1305, September 14, he is noticed in an inquisition into a distribution of lands.  He provides that lands of his fathers were not included in the inquisition into the lands of Christiana, widow of Robert Bruce.  In this Christopher Seton provides that she held the villa of Gamelesby and Unthank for life, by a grant of John de Seton.  She had granted these lands to herself and Robert Bruce and lawful heirs, thus failing the lands revert to John de Seton and hence Christopher Seton his son and heir.  The lands are to be held to the King by homage and service.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Bain; Calendar of documents relating to Scotland; Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/456/mode/2up No. 1690, page 456]&lt;/ref&gt;  This lady must be the second wife to [[Bruce-517|Robert Bruce]]; [[De_Ireby-2|Christiana]], daughter and heiress of Sir William de Ireby, of Ireby, Cumbria.  Later that year, 10 Oct, he performed homage for all his lands held to the king.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Bain; Calendar of documents relating to Scotland; Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/460/mode/2up No. 1697, page 460]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				In 1306 there is evidence that an estate in Annandale, presumably held to Bruce, Earl of Carrick was forfeit and the lands provided to Robert de Felton.&lt;ref&gt;Documents and Records Illustrating the History of Scotland; Palgrave; [https://archive.org/stream/documentsandrec00britgoog#page/n604/mode/2up Item 4 on page 302]&lt;/ref&gt;  These lands are stated to have been called Hoddmia (now Hoddam).&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] Sir Bruce Gordon Seton; The House of Seton [https://archive.org/stream/houseofsetonstv100seto#page78/mode/2up page 79]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Sir Bruce Gordon Seton suggests otherwise it seems, as mentioned by Balfour Paul, that these lands were a dowry for his wife, sister to Bruce.<br />
				Again, in 1306, 26 May, there are notices of his lands in Cumberland, those of Lambynby, Gamelesby and Unthank being forfeit, for treason, and provided to William de Latimer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Bain; Calendar of documents relating to Scotland; Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/476/mode/2up No. 1775, page 477]&lt;/ref&gt;  The very next Charter deals with the forfeiture of [[Bruce-129|Robert Bruce]] and the granting of his lands in Durham to Robert de Clifford; Clifford will also receive lands from the Seton forfeiture.  It must be presumed, and states such, that this relates to the murder of John Comyn, thus implying that Christopher Seton was with Robert Bruce at that event.  This last notice also indicates that he was dead by the time of the record, 15 October 1306.<br />
				The [[:Category:Battle of Methven|Battle of Methven]] took place near Perth on 19 June 1306.  Legend records that Seton saved Bruce after he fell from his horse and helped him escape the battlefield.  There is an account in Maitland's work.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Death===He is said to have escaped to Loch Doon Castle, in Carrick.  Barbour mentions that he was deceived by a Manab and handed over to the English.  He faced trial and execution at Dumfries.  On the site of his execution his widow, Christina, sister to Bruce, erected a chapel, and the King, Robert Bruce, arranged that Masses should be perpetually said for his soul.  "Christell's Chapel" was maintained "from the rent due to the King out of the barony of Carlaverocke".  It survived until 1552 and then fell into ruin.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] Sir Bruce Gordon Seton; The House of Seton [https://archive.org/stream/houseofsetonstv100seto#page80/mode/2up page 81]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				His execution, drawn and hanged, must have taken place just prior to 4 October 1306.  There is notice that the manor of Kenreston, in the bishopric of Durham, is held, as dower, to Ermina, widow of John de Seton and assignment by Christopher Seton.  His assignment was retained and the dower maintained and the manor granted to the king's servant, Geoffry of Hartlepool and his wife, Anna.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Bain; Calendar of documents relating to Scotland; Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/492/mode/2up No. 1841, page 493]&lt;/ref&gt;  She, Ermina, is mentioned in a later Charter, relating to the same lands, as being his mother.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Bain; Calendar of documents relating to Scotland; Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/504/mode/2up No. 1894, page 504]&lt;/ref&gt;  She was still alive in February 1307.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Family===He is known to have married [[Brus-105|Christina de Brus]], sister of King Robert I., and widow of [[Mar-84|Gratney (Gartnait), Earl of Mar]].  He died before September 1305 when Bruce is noticed as custodian of Kildrummy castle.  Sir Christopher was with Bruce at this point and the marriage likely occurring soon after, in early 1306.  She was still alive, and noted as his widow, at the house of Sixle, Carlisle on 15 March 1307.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Bain; Calendar of documents relating to Scotland; Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/508/mode/2up No. 1910, page 508]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Priory of Sixle was a Gilbertine Priory of Nuns in Lincolnshire, presumably with a Chapter House in Carlisle.  She likely went there for protection from pursuit but did not become a nun as she remarries.<br />
				There were no known children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] Sir Bruce Gordon Seton; The House of Seton [https://archive.org/stream/houseofsetonstv100seto#page/82/mode/2up page 82]&lt;/ref&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				====Conjecture====Some accounts suggests that there were two children from the marriage.  This seems impossible given they could only have been married four months at the most and much of that with Christopher Seton imprisoned.
