				===Marital problems===<br />
				'''1230''' William de Braose, 10th Baron Abergavenny, was executed for sleeping with Llywelyn's wife. They were caught in Llwelyn's bedroom.&lt;ref name=b /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In Easter 1230 William visited Llywelyn's court Garth Celyn, Aber Garth Celyn now known as Pen y Bryn, Abergwyngregyn. During this visit he was found in Llywelyn's chamber together with Llywelyn's wife Joan. On 2 May, De Braose was hanged in the marshland under Garth Celyn, the place now remembered as Gwern y Grog, Hanging Marsh, a deliberately humiliating execution for a nobleman, and Joan was placed under house arrest for a year.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				: Previously ... Braose allied with Llywelyn during his capture, and arranged a marriage  between his daughter Isabella and Llywelyn's heir, Dafydd ap Llywelyn. This was upheld after his execution. Shortly after Braose' death, a letter from Llywelyn to William's wife, Eva asks if  she still wants their kid's wedding to take place ... which did happen. Meanwhile, Joan was put on house arrest, but restored to her the next year.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywelyn_the_Great]
				</p>
				<p>
				===Death of Spouse===<br />
				'''1237''':  Joan died, "in February, at the court of Aber, and was buried in a new cemetery on the side of the strand ... Howel, bishop of Llanelwy, had consecrated. And in honour of her, [[Iorweth-1|Llywelyn]], son of Iorwerth, built there a monastery for barefooted monks, which is called Llanvaes in Mona. And then Ieuan, earl of Caerleon, and Cynvrig, son of the lord Rhys, died. That year, there came again a cardinal from Rome to England, sent, as his legate, by pope Gregory the ninth."&lt;ref name=b /&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===Strata Florida Abbey — council of 1238 &amp; son Dafydd ===<br />
				'''1238'''<br />
				: "The ensuing year, on the morrow after the feast of St. Luke the Evangelist [Oct. 19], all the princes of Wales sware fidelity to David, son of [[Iorweth-1|Llywelyn]], son of Iorwerth, at Strata Florida. And then he took, from his brother Gruffudd, Arwystli and Ceri and Cyveiliog and Mawddwy and Mochnant and Caereinion; leaving to him nothing but the cantrev of Lleyn itself. And then Maredudd, son of [[Gruffudd-57|Madog]], son of [[Madog-30|Gruffudd Maelor]], slew his brother Gruffudd; and immediately [[Iorweth-1|Llywelyn]], son of Iorwerth, divested him of his territory on that account."&lt;ref name=b /&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				=== Death ===<br />
				'''1240'''::"[[Iorweth-1|Llywelyn]], son of Iorwerth, prince of Wales, died ... and was buried at Aberconway, after taking the habit of religion. And after him David, his son, by Joan, the daughter of king John ... reigned. The month of May following, David, son of Llywelyn, having with him the barons of Wales, went to Gloucester, to do homage to the king his uncle, and to receive from him his territory lawfully. And then the English sent Walter Marshall, and an army with him, to fortify Aberteivi."&lt;ref name=b /&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===Burial of Llywelyn the Great===<br />
				According to Lee (1893), Llywelyn died 11 April 1240 at the Cisterician Abbey of Aberconwy, Arllechwedd Isaf, Caernarvonshire, Wales, where he had "taken on the habit of religion."  He is buried at the abbey.&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt;<br />
				Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, Prince of Aberffraw, Lord of Snowdon, died at Aberconway Abbey 11 April 1240, where he was buried.&lt;ref name=Richardson /&gt;<br />
				He was later reburied at Llanrwst Parish Church.  Gwydir Chapel next to the Church of St. Grwst in Llanrwst, Conway, Wales, contains the empty coffin of Llywelyn the Great. He was originally buried at Aberconwy Abbey, but his coffin was moved to the new abbey at Maenan when the Cistercian monks were forced to move there by Edward I.
				</p>
				<p>
				The whereabouts of Llywelyn's corpse remains a mystery. <br />
				(http;//www.walesdirectory.co.uk/Towns_in_Wales/Llanrwst_Town_2.htm)  <br />
				::Aberconway Abbey was also known as Aberconway Abbey Parish Church and is now known as St. Mary and All Saints Church, in Conwy, Conwy County, North Wales.

				|}'''ab, ap or ferch'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/1995-09/0811805168 Gen-Medieval Rootsweb post] by William A. Reitwiesner, September 1995&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				: "Ferch" actually means "daughter of", so if a woman was named "Elen ferch Llywelyn ap Gwilym", this would mean that her name was Elen, her father's name was Llywelyn, and her father's father's name was Gwilym. Properly, none of these words, "ap", "ab", or "ferch", are capitalized.<br />
				: The terms come from the fact that those are the words in the Welsh anguage which mean "son of" and "daughter of". Kind of like "filius" in Latin or "...sson" in Scandinavian languages.<br />
				: The difference between "ap" and "ab" is the sound which follows it. We do the same in the English language with "a bicycle" and "an orange". The spelling and pronunciation of the indefinite article changes depending on whether it preceeds a vowel sound or a consonant sound.<br />
				: In Welsh, "ap" comes before a consonant sound, thus "Einion ap Llywelyn", "Jenkin ap Gruffudd", "Llywarch ap Bran". "Ab", on the other hand, comes before a vowel sound, thus "Maredudd ab Einion", "Huw ab Owain". The reason I said "vowel sound" and not "vowel" is that in certain circumstances the initial letter "I" in Welsh can sound like a consonant. Thus "Rhys ap Iorwerth" and "Dafydd ap Ieuan". Kind of like in English where an initial "U" can sound like a consonant. We say "a university", not "an university".<br />
				: As you would expect, not everybody knows enough Welsh to handle patronyms properly, so you'll find lots of variations in the forms, even among people who write on Welsh genealogies. But the above is the correct Welsh way of doing things.<br />
				What's in a name? The following "Meaning &amp; History" information is from [http://www.behindthename.com Behind the Name]:*[http://www.behindthename.com/name/iorwerth Iorwerth]: Means "handsome lord" from Welsh ''ior'' "lord" and ''berth'' "handsome". This name is used in the Mabinogion, a collection of tales from Welsh myth, where it belongs to a son of Maredudd. This name is sometimes used as a Welsh form of Edward.*[http://www.behindthename.com/name/llywelyn Llywelyn]: Possibly a Welsh form of the old Celtic name Lugubelenus, a combination of the names of the gods LUGUS and BELENUS. Alternatively it may be derived from Welsh ''llyw'' "leader". This was the name of several Welsh rulers, notably the 13th-century Llywelyn the Great who fought against England.

But a recurring issue WikiTree hasn't really resolved -- Tangwystl was a mistress of long-standing and there's no way to list a mistress in the datafield.  Yes, the WikiTree convention is to simply list her as mother of the appropriate children and not show her as wife, but she's a significant enough person in the life of Llywelyn that she really does belong in the datafield.  There's a duplicate at the moment, which is easily resolved, but I wish the marriage/mistress issue in WikiTree's computer could be resolved as well!</span><br />

I changed his name as noted below &amp;amp; also added a Vitals section at the beginning so that his genealogical information can be easily found and an introduction at the start of the Biography section. I did not edit the detailed chronological info (any edit I did would be a bit heavy-handed, since I think details not pertinent to genealogy are best left to other sites).&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! Reading the profile &amp;amp; the comments, it appears some work is needed. First is his LNAB. Richardson and FMG/MedLands show him as Llywelyn ap Iorwerth. &lt;a href="http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Name_Fields_Welsh_Aristocrats" class="external text" title="http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Name_Fields_Welsh_Aristocrats" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cymru project naming guide&lt;/a&gt; says to include ap/ab/ferch in the LNAB. The discussion in the Notes section says ap is correct. Just to make sure, I've posted to G2G also: &lt;a href="http://www.wikitree.com/g2g/218248/notice-of-change-from-iorweth-to-ap-iorwerth" class="external free" title="http://www.wikitree.com/g2g/218248/notice-of-change-from-iorweth-to-ap-iorwerth" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.wikitree.com/g2g/218248/notice-of-change-from-iorweth-to-ap-iorwerth&lt;/a&gt;</span><br />
