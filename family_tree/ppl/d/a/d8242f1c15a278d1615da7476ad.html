				== Biography ==Balfour Paul provides&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/520/mode/2up page 520]&lt;/ref&gt; that he was the eldest son of Robert Fleming, one of the supporters of Robert Bruce and was with Bruce when he murdered Sir John Comyn in the church of the convent of the MinoriteFriars.  Fleming is the one that entered the church with Kirkpatrick and others and chopped off Comyn's head, returning it to Bruce to prove he was now dead.  The words he spoke to Bruce "Let the deed show" became the family motto.  His father died shortly before 1314.<br />
				Balfour Paul is silent regarding any participation at the Battle of Bannockburn which is unusual.  William Hunter,&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] William Hunter;  [https://archive.org/details/biggarhouseoffle1867hunt#page/470/mode/2up page 470]&lt;/ref&gt; likely accurately, suggests he was ".. appears to have given a warm support to the cause of Robert Bruce.  He was, no doubt, present with his retainers at the battle of Bannockburn.  Robert Bruce, in consideration of his eminent services, conferred upon him the charters of several lands."  Amongst these were the titles to Lenzie and Cumbernauld, ex-Comyn lands, in Dumbartonshire in December 1314.  He also received Auchendenan, in Renfrewshire, and Pontoun (Polton), in Wigtonshire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Peter MacKerlie; [https://archive.org/stream/historylandsand01mackgoog#page/n42/mode/2up page 27]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				There are a number of undated Charters noted in Robertson's Index that suggest Malcolm was a member of Bruce's Household knights.  It could be presumed, as they are of lands of Sir John Comyn, that it occurred after Bannockburn and that Malcolm was a part of Bruce's group.  He received, in payment of a Knights fee, the barony of Kirkintilloch. <br />
				One such Charter provides "Robert (Bruce), King of Scotland.  Be it known that we have given, and by this our present charter confirmed, to Malcolm Fleming, our well-beloved and faithful soldier, for his homage and service, the whole barony of Kirkintilloch, with its pertinents, which formerly belonged to John Comyn, Knight, holding and to be held by the said Malcolm and his heirs from us and our heirs, by all its proper boundaries,........ the said Malcolm and his heirs rendering to us and our heirs the service of a knight in our army, and suit in the court of the Sheriffdom of Dumbarton".<br />
				In 1316, he was Sheriff of Dumbarton and Governor of Dumbarton castle, a key Royal castle.  In this capacity he witnessed a charter by Walter Stewart,  the High Steward, of the church of Largs to the monks of Paisley in 1316.<br />
				In 1321, 19 May, he appears as the beneficiary, from Walter Stewart, the High Steward, of a grant of an annuity of 13 pounds, 6s. 8d. payable to him by the abbot and convent of Holyroodhouse out of the barony and lands of Kerse, in the county of Stirling.<br />
				In 1329 his son marries and a payment was made to him.  His accounts as Steward of the King's house and as Sheriff of Dumbarton are dated at Newbattle Abbey on 16 January 1330.<br />
				He was in the second division of the Scottish army at the [[:Category:Battle of Halidon Hill|battle of Halidon Hill]] on 19 July 1333, but was one of the few who escaped.  He proceeded to the castle of Dumbarton and defended the castle, making it a refuge not only for King David and his Queen, but for their followers.<br />
				In 1333, he had a safe-conduct from Edward III. to come into England on the King's business.<br />
				In 1334, he also found means in May to convey the King (David II) and Queen to France for greater safety.  After the King returned to Scotland on 4 May 1341 the King granted a charter to him, on 9 November following, of the lands of Farynes and Rinnys and all the burgh of Wigtown and the royal lands in the sheriffdom thereof, together with the title of EARL OF WIGTOWN to him and the heirs-male of his body.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Balfour Paul; Vol 8, [https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun08pauluoft#page/520/mode/2up page 521]&lt;/ref&gt;  The King further bestowed on him a grant of regality, with power to judge in the four pleas of the Crown, making him one of the most powerful men in the Kingdom with powers close to the King himself.<br />
				Later that year, 6 July 1344, as Earl of Wigtown, granted an annualrent of 100 shillings, payable from the lands of Carse and Bulschalach in Kyleregis to the friars preachers of St. Katherine of Ayr, for the benefit of his soul and the souls of his parents, and a further charter of six merks annually for support of one friar officiating as priest in the chapel of the said friars.  His seal, which was attached to the Charter, bears a chevron within a double tressure.<br />
				In 1342, he was Governor of the castle of Dumbarton at a yearly salary of one hundred merks.  On 18 June 1342 he had a charter of the lands of Kerdones (Cardoness), in Galloway, from King David II. in excambion (exchange) for the lands of Mochrum which theKing had formerly given him.  He also received three other charters from David II. of the lands of Lenzie, Kilmaronock, and the barony of Dalliell in free warren, the lands of Rinnes of Wigtown (consolidating his lands in Galloway), and the lands of Sithboger in the barony of Lenzie forfeited by Thomas Balcasky (this being confirmation of lands forfeited by one of his own nobles).<br />
				About 1346, he made a donation to the monastery of Newbattle, for the benefit of his soul, which is witnessed by Duncan and Walter Flemings.  He had a charter of the flve-merk lands of Carmnole and Knoclucbirvan.  Balfour, while noting the witnesses to the Charter does not provide insight into who they might have been.<br />
				He was taken prisoner at the [[:Category:Battle of Neville's Cross|Battle of Neville's Cross]] on 17 October 1346, along with his cousin [[Fleming-493|Sir Malcolm Fleming of Biggar]].  He was captured by and then committed to Robert Bertram, Sheriff of Northumberland.  Either Bertram released them or they escaped but he was excepted to have held them at the castle of Newcastle until he should be transferred to the Tower ofLondon.  They had escaped, or been released, prior to 2 May 1347 the date when a warrant for Bertram's arrest was issued.  Bertram was severely punished and went from a notable public figure to an impoverished Knight overnight.  All his lands were seized and he was forfeit.<br />
				In 1357, he was at the Parliament at Edinburgh, 26 September 1357, when commissioners were appointed to conclude the treaty for the ransom of David II..&lt;ref&gt;APS, i, 516-17; Foedera, iii(i), 370-1.  Original in TNA(PRO) E39, Exchequer: Treasury of Receipt: Scottish Documents.  Recorded on The [http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/A1357/9/2 Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was likely at Berwick for the exchange, 3 October 1357.   He appended his seal to the documents in this case, and gave his grandson,Thomas, as one of the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] William Hunter; [https://archive.org/details/biggarhouseoffle1867hunt#page/476/mode/2up page 477]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				In the same year he granted the lands of Kyllinsith in Dumbartonshire to Robert de la Vail (Vale), and the lands of Hallys and  Letbernard in Edinburghshire (Midlothian) to Robert Dumbarton, Clerk of Register.<br />
				He is said to have died about 1362 and was followed by his grandson, Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-2]] William Hunter; [https://archive.org/details/biggarhouseoffle1867hunt#page/476/mode/2up page 477]&lt;/ref&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
				===Family===He married a lady with a Christian name of Marjorie, said to be the King's nurse.  The King, presumably David II., gave her, cloth and furs.  David at the time was about 5 and thus Marjory was his nurse; Robert Bruce having died in June this must have occurred after and about Oct 1329.  The marriage must have occurred well prior (see notes below).  She appears to have died in Nov 1343 as there is notice of the appointment of a confessor.  They had a number of children:<br />
				* John Fleming (Balfour Paul was not aware of his name but it is provided by William Hunter).  John died just prior to 1351 as Thomas, his son, appears as a hostage in 1351, likely young; leaving Thomas who will inherit from his grandfather.  John must likely have been born about 1320 and thus Thomas young when he died.<br />
				* Unknown; a daughter, who was married to Sir John Danielston of that Ilk.  He had a charter from Sir Malcolm Fleming of the island of Inchcailloch, in Loch Lomond, and the lands of Kilmaronock.  This likely occurring at the marriage but it is, however, undated.<br />
				* Marjory Fleming, who was married to William of Fawsyde.  They had a charter of the mill of Tollygart, called Lyndmill, part of the Crown lands of Clackmannan, on 18 October 1364.<br />
				* Evota Fleming, who was married to John of Ramsay, probably in 1342, when she returned from Court, supposed by Balfour Paul.  The King bestowed the thanage of Tannadyce on them before 1359.
				</p>
				<p>
				===Dates of Family Events===<br />
				There is confusion regarding the dates of birth of his family and the dates of events noticed above suggest errors.  If, for example, Malcolm and Marjorie did marry in 1329 there is no time for Thomas, the grandson, to be of age in 1351 when he appears as a Hostage for King David II. if he is of a child to them.   He  must have been young.  John, the eldest son, never receives a grant of land or at least one noticed on record, indeed does nothing noticed on record; he too must not have been of age although he had one child.<br />
				There is no attempt in source work to discuss dates.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fleming,_Earl_of_Wigtown wikipedia] article for his grandson, Thomas, is incorrect in that it has him born after his stated captivity in 1354, also incorrect, and states his mother as Marjorie when this was his grandmother.  Balfour Paul notes that Thomas, the grandson and next Earl, "was a hostage for King David II. when he was permitted to visit his dominions on 4 September 1351, and the heir of the Earl of Wigtown was one of the hostages named in the treaty for the liberation of His Majesty on 13 July 1354, and as such was in the custody of the Sheriff of Northumberland on 10 November 1358."  He cannot be discussing the same person; in 1351 he, as Earl, was permitted to return to inspect his dominions and, in 1354, he, as Heir, was one of the hostages named.  In 1351 the Earl was Malcolm (this person), of which there can be no doubt and it must have been he that "returned".  Balfour Paul also appears to be loose with dates and implies that Thomas was a hostage from 1354.  But the Parliament, noted above in the bio, that sent Thomas to England was in 1357 and Thomas was hostage for the payment of ransom, not the King, and after David's release.  Needless to say it does not provide a date of birth.<br />
				Rymer's notice in the Foedera for Sep 1351 &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/fderaconventione03ryme#page/n115/mode/2up Foedera Acts on Public Records 1351 (page 73) ]&lt;/ref&gt; is useful.  It provides that Thomas, Grandson (nepos) and heir to the Earl of Wigtown was in England and part of a general release to return. <br />
				Rymer's notice in the Foedera for 1354 &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/fderaconventione03ryme#page/n141/mode/2up Foedera Acts on Public Records 1354 ]&lt;/ref&gt; does not provide much assistance.  It provides that the son and heir to the Earl of Wigtown was offered as a hostage for David in the negotiations.<br />
				Rymer's notice in the Foedera for 1358 &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/fderaconventione03ryme#page/n223/mode/2up Foedera Acts on Public Records 1358 ]&lt;/ref&gt; does not provide much assistance.  While stating "Thomam Flemyng" was at the exchange for David II., and in the custody of the Sheriff of Northumberland in 1358 it provides nothing more.<br />
				Balfour Paul notices that Thomas was granted "a charter, dated at Perth 26 January  1367, of the earldom of Wigtown, which the late Malcolm his grandfather had held, but which for certain causes had remained in suspension, ....".  Unfortunately he does not mention for how long it was in suspension but it clearly suggests he was of age in 1367 which, if the suspension was short, would suggest a birth of 1340.<br />
				For these events to correlate Thomas must have been very young in 1351 and his father, John, likely not of age when he died in 1350.  The marriage likely did occur close to 1329 or slightly prior.  John was likely born 1326 and died prior to being of age and in 1349 but had married prior with Thomas born in 1346 and thus 5 in 1351.<br />
				The suspension on the Earldom was probably caused, not as Balfour Paul suggests by Archibald Douglas, although he no doubt played a large part in the destabilisation, but due to the need to prove legitimacy.  This must have been proved however as the grant was made.
