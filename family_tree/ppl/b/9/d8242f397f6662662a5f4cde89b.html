				<p>
				[[Category:Clan MacKay]]
				</p>
				<p>
				== Biography ==<br />
				Donald Mackay is said to have been murdered, along with his father, by Nicolas Sutherland, at Dingwall, in 1370.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Angus Mackay; page 50&lt;/ref&gt;  He appears on no other record and this date is the key date for calculating his life events.  He was known to have been married by then, although his wife is not mentioned, and to have had children, two certainly and another two mentioned in Sir Robert Gordon's work [https://archive.org/details/genealogicalhist00gord Genealogical history of the Earldom of Sutherland] which may or may not be accurate.<br />
				His son, [[Mackay-1317|Angus]], was a "youth" when he died and Angus Mackay&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Angus Mackay; page 52&lt;/ref&gt; suggests he may have been behind the sudden demise and death of the Earl of Sutherland in 1370.  Assuming this supposition to be close to accurate we could presume him to be in his late teens, thus the marriage of Donald and his wife must have taken place around 1355 at the latest.  Donald was therefore born around 1330.
				</p>
				<p>
				He is said to have had a number of children, two definitely;
				</p>
				<p>
				* Angus, who will succeed his grandfather lye. <br />
				* Huistean Du (Hugh the dark), born about 1360, who will become tutor to Angus Du, the son of his elder brother Angus, during his nephew's minority.  There is no notice of him marrying.  He is said to led Clan Mackay at the [[:Category: Battle of Tuiteam Tarbhach|Battle of Tuiteam Tarbhach]] in his nephew's minority and to have died 2 years after; thus about 1408.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Robert Mackay; page 50&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				Another, likely illegitimate or a relative, as they will use another patronymic:<br />
				Neil, who seems to have settled in Creich, Sutherland.  Again Robert Gordon is the original source.  While a Neil did exist there is no original source to suggest he was a son of Mackay.  However, according to Angus Mackay (also noted, in more detail, in [http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/conflict/Druimnacour.html Conflicts of the Clans], he had three sons Thomas, Morgan, and Neil.  Robert Mackay, although his dates are incorrect, suggests Thomas and Neil were legitimate while Morgan was not.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-3]] Robert Mackay; page 50&lt;/ref&gt;  This has more merit than Angus Mackay and is supported by later events.  Robert Gordon&lt;ref&gt;Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland&lt;/ref&gt; names all his sons MacNeil.  Thomas (Neilson), clearly the oldest, held the main lands of Creich, Spanzedell, and Polrossie, in Sutherland.  He had a feud, said to be 1427, with a Mowat, Lord of Freswick (although Angus Mackay notes him as Mowatt of Bucholly (Aberdeenshire)).  Thomas MacNeil is said to have fought with Mowat and pursued him to the Chapel of St. Dufus, near Tain, in Ross, which he then burnt to the ground killing Mowat.  <br />
				King James I, already incensed with the squabbling amongst the clans, declares him an outlaw and places a bounty of his lands on him.  Some sources, including Angus Mackay, note that Neilson held his lands to Angus Du Mackay, but this seems improbable given the position of the King.  This is noted in A. J. Lawrence's work on ''The Clan Bain'', saying that Thomas, “held vast possessions, including the lands of Creich, etc., which he obtained from his cousin, Angus Du—probably to get and ensure his support.  If he were "cousin" this would not have been necessary.<br />
				Now the legend varies; his brothers had either already married the daughters to Angus Moray of Cubin or that was part of the bribe.  From [http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/conflict/Druimnacour.html Conflicts of the Clans], which seems the most reasonable and likely: "Angus Murray of Cubin, understanding the King's proclamation, had secret conference with Morgan and Neil Mackay, brethren to this Thomas.  Angus offered unto them, if they would assist him to apprehend their brother, that he would give them his own two daughters in marriage, and also assist them to get the peaceful possession of Strathnaver, which they did claim as due to them, and (as he thought) they might easily obtain the same, with little or no resistance at all, seeing that [[Mackay-1313|Neil Wasse Mackay]] (the son of [[Mackay-1314|Angus Dow]]) lay prisoner in the Bass, and Angus Dow himself was unable (by reason of the weakness of his body at that time) to withstand them."  It proceeds: "Morgan Mackay and Neil Mackay do condescend and yield to the bargain; and presently, thereupon, they did apprehend their brother, Thomas, at Spanzedell, in Sutherland, and delivered him to Angus Murray, who presented him to the King, at whose command Thomas Macneil was executed at Inverness; and the lands of Polrossie and Spanzedell, which he did possess, were given to Angus Murray for this service; which lands his successors retained.  Angus Murray, for performance of his promise made to Neil and Morgan Mackay, gave him his two daughters in marriage."<br />
				This strongly supports the supposition that Neil was illegitimate and likely the eldest son, as he claims to have a right to the lands of Strathnaver.  Further it provides that the lands of Creich were held to the Mackays while Polrossie and Spanzedell were held to the Crown.  It also suggests that Angus Du was near bed-ridden, a fact which is also recorded by Angus Mackay.  The heir to the Clan Mackay, Neil Wasse, a prisoner of the Crown.  It clearly suggests this was a family coup, particularly when considering that Angus Murray was at "war" with Angus Du Mackay, one that will lead to the [[:Category: Battle of Drumnacoub|Battle of Drumnacoub]].<br />
				Morgan Neilson seems to have settled in Brae-Chat.  Neil Neilson obtained from King James I., 20 Mar 1430, a charter of the lands of Creich, Gerloch, Daane, Moyzeblary, Croinzneorth, Tutumtarwauch, Langort and Amayde, in the Earldoms of Ross and Sutherland, escheated from his deceased brother, Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Register of the Great Seal; vol 2, Charter no 147, page 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this Charter however he is called Nigello Nelesoun.  Neil (Nigel) must have been the older brother.  Both these brothers would die, with Angus Moray of Cubin, fighting against their "kin" at the Battle of Drumnacoub, which places the battle after March 1430.  <br />
				The legend continues that the sons of Neil Neilson were: — John Bain who settled in Caithness and became the progenitor of the Bains in that county; Angus, progenitor of the Siol-Angus; and Paul who became progenitor of the Poisons and some MacPhails.<br />
				And a fourth son, mentioned by Angus Mackay but not by Robert Mackay, where he uses material by Robert Gordon (which is clearly in doubt):&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-1]] Angus Mackay; page 50&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
				* Martin, of whom nothing is known save that he settled in Galloway, according to Sir Robert Gordon.  This is used to justify a link between the Mackays of Strathnaver and those of Galloway although the link may never have existed.
